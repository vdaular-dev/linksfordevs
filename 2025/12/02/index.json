    "Description": "Is it wise to start a Computer Science degree in 2026? Is AI going to take all of the software development jobs? These are especially relevant questions for me as my son graduates from high school this year. This is the advice I gave him.\nI believe it is a fine choice to take Computer Science in the year 2026, provided the following two things are true:\nYou love it - The days of this degree guaranteeing a good-paying job are over. If you are just in it for the money, take up a trade which pays well and is in high demand. Competition for jobs, especially at the entry level, will remain high, so this is only a place for people who love it. You have the mind for it - If you don’t have strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills, you are better off looking elsewhere. The mediocre or below-average software developer will be the first to be displaced by AI. I graduated with my Computer Science degree at a funny time. The year was 2003, and we had just navigated through the dot-com bust. Similar to the market today, it was very challenging to find work. For the next few years, the common wisdom was “Don’t take Computer Science”. High School guidance counsellors were advising students to stay away. I remember visiting my University and was shocked to see how much the CS school had shrunk. Just a few years later, in 2008, I was having a terrible time trying to hire people. There were simply too few people with the skills required."

I’m not very good at point-and-click 3d modelling tools, and this is kind of a casual hobby rather than serious work so I used Claude Code, an AI programming assistant, to vibe code a parametric Python program to generate the printable files. It was a real rush to find out I can just start verbally describing the object I want to an AI agent and then be holding it in my hand less than three hours later! So here’s the story of how I vibe CADed my very own 1960s-inspired Bertin reorderable matrix."
