It goes like this:\n— Of course we use microservices. Our authorization lives in a separate microservice, game logic and stats live in the second microservices, and our PostgreSQL DB is a third microservice.\n— Wait, but your main logic service is not really “micro”. And your PostgreSQL storage is neither, it’s handling hell lot of responsibilities."
