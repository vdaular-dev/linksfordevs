The figure on the left shows what my terminal looks like currently. The prefix before the $ sign does not contain a lot of information which I can use in my current directory. It displays three things in order, the current host, current dir and the user name"

    "Description": "Last year, when I started learning Golang, and while building a project, I needed to work with databases. I stumbled upon an interesting conundrum in the Golang community: Everyone here seems to hate ORMs.\nI wondered why. Coming from ecosystems like Python (Django/SQLAlchemy), the ORM is usually the default starting point. Although I went my way with writing SQL queries by hand for that specific project, recently this question again resurfaced in my mind."
