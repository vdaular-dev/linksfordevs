Agentic AI assistants use embedding models together with a vector database to perform semantic search over a project’s code.\nThis setup is similar to what projects like DeepWiki1 do, but it runs entirely on local hardware. After indexing the codebase and storing the embedding vectors in Qdrant, I can start talking to the code in natural language."
