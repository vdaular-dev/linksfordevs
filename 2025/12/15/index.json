You get a small number of windows where risk tolerance, energy, capital, and conviction align.\nIn The Black Swan Nassim Taleb frames this as asymmetric exposure to unlimited upside with limited downside. And startups are one of the clearest modern mechanisms for that kind of asymmetry. But what’s often missed is that these opportunities are finite. You can’t swing endlessly. Most of life is spent accumulating the resources—knowledge, capital, relationships—that make the next swing possible.\nWhat follows are six moments where those resources briefly line up."

And how does it compare to ChatGPT’s approach?\nThis is the second post in a series where I reverse-engineer the memory systems of popular AI assistants. The first post focused on ChatGPT’s memory system."
