    "Description": "By applying Herbert Simon’s concept of satisficing to AI, this post argues that language models might prefer logical‐sounding content over emotional appeals, mirroring human biases but inverted. It unveils a paradox: humans use emotion to decide rationally, while LLMs use pseudo‐rational style to appear helpful."

    "Description": "Most open source advocates, and many security professionals, often say things like “open source software is secure because you can just read the code”.\nThis argument assumes that the ability to read source code directly translates into the ability to understand, verify, and trust it, because you can see the files this software opens or the network sockets it listens on. You can see the kind of network data it sends, and the cryptography it uses.\n"

    "Description": "NATS is a distributed streaming system. Regular NATS streams offer only best-effort delivery, but a subsystem, called JetStream, guarantees messages are delivered at least once. We tested NATS JetStream, version 2.12.1, and found that it lost writes if data files were truncated or corrupted on a minority of nodes. We also found that coordinated power failures, or an OS crash on a single node combined with network delays or process pauses, can cause the loss of committed writes and persistent split-brain. This data loss was caused (at least in part) by choosing to flush writes to disk every two minutes, rather than before acknowledging them. We also include a belated note on data loss due to process crashes in version 2.10.22, which was fixed in 2.10.23. NATS has now documented the risk of its default fsync policy, and the remaining issues remain under investigation. This research was performed independently by Jepsen, without compensation, and conducted in accordance with the Jepsen ethics policy."
