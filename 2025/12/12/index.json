    "Description": "The new LLM world is very exciting, and I try to experiment with the new tools when I can. This includes building agentic applications, one of which is my personal accounting and invoicing tool - that I wrote about previously As part of that effort I started experimenting with RubyLLM to have some view into items in my system. And while I have used a neat pattern for referencing objects in the application from the tool calls - the Rails Global ID system - it turned out to be quite treacherous. So, let’s have a look at where GlobalID may bite you, and examine alternatives and tweaks we can do. What are Rails GIDs? The Rails global IDs (“GIDs”) are string handles to a particular model in a Rails application. Think of it like a model URL. They usually have the form of gid://awesome-app/Post/32. That comprises: The name of your app (roughly what you passed in when doing rails new) The class name of the model The primary key of the model You can grab a model in your application and get a global ID for it: moneymaker(dev):001> Invoice.last.to_global_id Invoice Load (0.3ms) SELECT \"invoices\".* FROM \"invoices\" ORDER BY \"invoices\".\"id\" DESC LIMIT 1 /*application='Moneymaker'*/ => #<GlobalID:0x00000001415978a0 @uri=#<URI::GID gid://moneymaker/Invoice/161>> Rails uses those GIDs primarily in ActiveJob serialization. When you do DebitFundsJob.perform_later(customer) where the customer is your Customer model object which is stored in the DB, ActiveJob won’t serialize its attributes but instead serialize it as a “handle” - the global ID. When your job gets deserialized from the queue, the global ID is going to get resolved into a SELECT and your perform method will get the resulting Customer model as argument. All very neat. And dangerous, sometimes - once LLMs become involved."

Making inside jokes and coming up with clever acronyms to make each other laugh (and hopefully score points too!). I actually wrote a version of this back in 2017 as part of my prototypes that came before Gametje. This one is luckily far more polished visually and with proper gameplay mechanics. Meet AcroByte:"
