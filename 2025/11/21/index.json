It's logical that we aren't as resourceful with the hardware today as we were in the 80s, because the hardware is so powerful today that we can afford to be lazy with our programming and still have our programs run smoothly. But the weird part is that software seems to degrade more than it should."

    "Description": "After building a software company to a multi-billion dollar exit, I made the jump to hardware. Now I’m working on carbon removal + steel at Charm Industrial, and electric long-haul trucking with Revoy. It’s epically fun to be building in the real world, but little did I expect that more than half the cost of building a hardware company would come from regulatory bottlenecks. Despite a huge push for climate fixes and the bipartisan geopolitical desire to bring industry back to the USA, I’ve been shocked to find that the single biggest barrier—by far—is over-regulation from the massive depth of bureaucracy."
