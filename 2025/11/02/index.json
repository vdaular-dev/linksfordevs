    "Description": "Quickstrom is a property-based\ntesting tool for web applications, using QuickLTL for specifying the\nintended behavior. QuickLTL is a linear temporal logic (LTL) over finite\ntraces, especially suited for testing. As with many other logic systems,\nwhen a formula evaluates to false — like when a counterexample to a\nsafety property is found or a liveness property cannot be shown to hold\n— the computer says no. That is, you get “false” or “test failed”,\nperhaps along with a trace. Understanding complex bugs in stateful\nsystems then comes down to staring at the specification alongside the\ntrace, hoping you can somehow pin down what went wrong. It’s not\ngreat."

I needed crazy text effects, and I needed them to\nbe reasonably fast, which implied working with the GPU as much as possible. The\ndistance field was an obvious requirement because it unlocks anti-aliasing and\nthe ability to make many great effects for basically free."
