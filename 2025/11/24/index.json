I used Tinker to fine-tune my own LLM, a product released by the team at Thinking Machines Lab.\nIt did a great job, and produced generally usable React code at a better level that I expected it to from an online dataset."

Almost every role I have landed came through a single conversation focused entirely on the projects I had built.\nThe reason is simple: proof of work makes interviews optional.\nI didn’t come from a big-name college. There was no built-in reputation attached to where I studied, and no advantage from well known tags like IIT, GSOC, or Big Tech internships."
