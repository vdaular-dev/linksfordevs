    "Description": "In our datacenter, we faced a recurring challenge when configuring several servers tasks such as setting the system time, updating passwords, and, most importantly, configuring the RAID controller. Our goal was to combine two 10 TB disks into a RAID 1 group for installing VMware ESXi, which only requires about 2 GB of disk space. This approach, however, meant wasting over 9 TB of usable storage just to install a lightweight hypervisor. Using stateless ESXi wasn’t an option, so we needed a better way to manage the RAID configuration directly in order to create two Virtual Drives one with 100GB for the ESXi and rest of it as data disk."
