The time and place for the imposition for structure will come, but it comes later.\nThere is no universal guide for what to do and how to spend your time.

    "Description": "Working with Couchbase for the past year and a half has been more than just learning a database. It has been an exercise in system thinking: seeing how indexes, queries, consistency, and durability interact, and how small design choices ripple through performance and reliability.\nThis essay is my personal notebook from that journey. It is technically dense because Couchbase demands precision, but it is also reflective because the lessons extend beyond one database. Understanding how array indexes multiply entries, why compound index order matters, or how query consistency flags change latency is not just about Couchbase, it is about learning to think in terms of systems, trade‑offs, and consequences."
