    "Description": "PlanetScale’s new $5 single-node PostgreSQL tier (PS-5) promises the same observability/maintenance story you get from their Vitess-backed MySQL side. I wanted to see how it feels next to the very boring Postgres instance I already pay for: a Hetzner CPX11 (2 vCPU / 2 GB RAM for €3.85) running in their eu-central region (Nuremberg). This isn’t even LAN vs internet—it’s literally local disk vs a remote region—so the goal is to get a sanity check, not crown a winner."
