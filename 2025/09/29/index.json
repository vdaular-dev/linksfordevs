The whole place is designed to make a profit, and it does. That’s the house, but what if the house is online? That definitely changes things. The frontend interacts with the backend, and we may not be able to access the backend, but we can still tinker with what we can access. We can inspect the often obfuscated JavaScript and watch the HTTP requests being sent out. Those requests are what we leverage today to exploit the house and, yes, make money out of thin air."
