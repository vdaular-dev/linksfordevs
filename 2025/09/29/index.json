    "Description": "They say the house never loses, which, according to my recent trip to Vegas, seemed true. Security watches closely, slots are programmed to be addictive yet unfair. The whole place is designed to make a profit, and it does. That’s the house, but what if the house is online? That definitely changes things. The frontend interacts with the backend, and we may not be able to access the backend, but we can still tinker with what we can access. We can inspect the often obfuscated JavaScript and watch the HTTP requests being sent out. Those requests are what we leverage today to exploit the house and, yes, make money out of thin air."

That’s where it’s tricky to separate the art from the artist and consider if and how you want to support it. This gets even trickier when you find out more about the person, they get caught doing horrible things or their fame gets to their head and they start promoting a terrible opinion about something just because they can."
