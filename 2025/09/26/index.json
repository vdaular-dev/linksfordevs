That dream has slowly materialized over the years, and I would like to showcase it here.\nSo currently, all my applications run on my Arch Linux machines. I am using Arch Linux mainly because I have spent considerable amount of time customising it. I learned Linux with Arch, and gained knowledge of systemd, the Linux filesystem, and manual package management via pacman. And as it has worked well for me all this time, I believe, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”"

    "Domain": "yons.ch",
    "Description": "When learning to program, students are often asked to implement a function that converts an integer to a string. Usually, what they come up with (and what they are expected to come up with) is to iteratively use division by 10 to get the digits of the number one by one. While this certainly works, division is considered an expensive operation, and so constrained systems (and perhaps standard implementations as well) use an algorithm called “Double Dabble” to get the decimal representation of a number."
