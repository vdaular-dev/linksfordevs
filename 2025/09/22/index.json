Since the passphrase was found on the usual rockyou.txt wordlist, I was curious to see if the remaining three could be cracked using the same wordlist.\nI started this project by writing a small utility to decrypt the PVK key, as it could be easily tested with the known passphrase. The code appeared correct, but it wasn’t working."

    "Description": "Having spent some time across quite distinct infrastructure codebases and developer environments, from isolated,\n            simple platforms to large monolithic behemoths, I have seen a common pattern to solving new infrastructure problems. First, an engineer performs effective discovery\n            to decide if someone else has solved the same problem that you are facing. Next, if the organization\n            requires a domain-specific solution, they create an MVP that demonstrates the merits of the new system."
