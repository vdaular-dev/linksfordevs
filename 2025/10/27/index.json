In this video, we break down:\nWhy early programmers panicked when Grace Hopper introduced compilers\nHow AI tools like ChatGPT compare to human intelligence\nThe repeating cycles of hype and disappointment in AI history\nWhy software development is far from fully automatable\nThe risks of pivoting careers based on AI “doom predictions”\nAI is a tool, not a replacement—for now. Understand the trends, separate hype from reality, and make informed career decisions.\n\n\nSources:\nhttps://youtu.be/HD0L3lQ9cms?si=4skwzUgqKYMHC9Op"

Then I saw a post from Andrew Kelley (creator of the language) on Hacker News, about how he reimplemented my Chromaprint algorithm in Zig, and that got me really interested."

The attention mechanism (which I later\nlearned originated from Dzmitry Bahdanau’s 2014 work) seemed like a remarkably\nelegant solution. It captivated me, sparking my deep dive into AI and shaping my\ncareer in applying these models to real-world problems, but I never imagined it\nwould become the phenomenon it is today."

The architecture uses hierarchical reasoning through recursion of transformer layers—effectively running the same parameters through multiple forward passes to reach impressive small model performance."
