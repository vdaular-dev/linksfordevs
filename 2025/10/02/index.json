That contract states that, essentially, a winner is not entitled to receive their prize unless they allow Loto Québec to run news and ads featuring them."

If you’ve been around the block as many times as some of us have, you’ll have earned battle scars along the way. There are days in war rooms you will never forget. You have experimented a lot, and you have failed more times than you care to remember. You have half-a-head full of what is practical and works. And a quarter of that space has been trained to look for red flags, scanning for things that you know will go wrong."

I suppose, the Starship Enterprise-D made its first appearance on the airwaves in 1987. So at the time I guess we could expect a replicator to be programmed in C."
