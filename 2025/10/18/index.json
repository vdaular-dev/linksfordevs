    "Description": "Bézier curves are a core building block of text and 2D shapes rendering.\nThere are several approaches to rendering them, but one especially challenging\nproblem, both mathematically and technically, is computing the distance to\na Bézier curve. For quadratic curves (one control point), this is fairly\naccessible, but for cubic (two control points) we're going to see why it is\nso hard."

Like there must be some secret sauce you’re missing.\nBut there isn’t. The core of an agent is surprisingly simple: an LLM, a loop, and enough context. Everything else is just good engineering."
