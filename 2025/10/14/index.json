    "Description": "I’ve recently been doing a bunch of research into international payments, stablecoins, and the role of the US dollar in the world today. What surprised me when reading the online discourse (the comments section) was how often people seemed to be talking past each other about technologies and systems, mainly because they had a different answer to the question: how much should the government control currency[1]?"

    "Description": "I just watched a machine learn to speak. Over the course of 4 hours, for £75 ($100), I trained my own conversational AI from scratch. Not by using an API or fine-tuning someone else’s model - I mean actually training a language model, watching it go from random noise to something that can hold a conversation.\nIt’s a strange experience. You’re essentially watching intelligence emerge from mathematics.\nThe setup I used nanochat as my foundation - Andrej Karpathy’s “minimal, hackable” implementation of the full LLM training pipeline. The beauty of nanochat is that it’s simple enough to understand but complete enough to actually work. No mysterious or bloated frameworks - just the core process laid bare."

Convenience is all destination and no journey. This piece well predates the current AI boom, but “all destination and no journey” is a pretty good explanation for why using AI to create art is mainly compelling to people who think about creativity in terms of producing content and generating intellectual property. They just want the thing they can market and sell for money or clout; they don’t care how they got there. I know you’re sick of talking about AI. I am too. This is only a little bit about AI, I promise. Like all my writing about technology, it’s mostly about people."
