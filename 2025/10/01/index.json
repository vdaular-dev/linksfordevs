    "Description": "It’s been a while since I’ve worked on mapgen4 features. In 2018 I declared it finished[1]. I then put it away and worked on other projects. Over the years I have updated the code (es6 modules, typescript, pointer events, boundary points, pnpm) without adding any features. I had been leaving all feature updates for a future map generator."

Managing multiple conversations, maintaining context across sessions, and ensuring quality all require different approaches than single-session work.\nThis series documents those problems and the solutions that emerged. The tools shown use Claude Code and Emacs, but the patterns apply broadly to any LLM workflow."
