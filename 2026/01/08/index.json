They fall into a few categories: the mathematics of data privacy, popular mathematics, politics, and nineteenth century philosophy. For data privacy, we look at how technical details may be hindering adoption of differential privacy as well as scaling laws for differentially private language models. Next, we look at excellent popular math articles introducing the Collatz conjecture and the Busy Beaver numbers. In politics, we explore paranoid eighteenth century political rhetoric as well as John Maynard Keynes’ reflections on the Liberal party after a disastrous election in 1924. Finally, we look at two philosophical movements in mid-nineteenth century America and an 1875 article on the relation between the verifiability and discoverability of truths.\n\n"
