    "Description": "Short answer: There are two extremes in our world—hyper-connected world of rich countries, and a disconnected world of underserved communities like rural Africa.\nI've seen both, and I conclude that being in a low-resource and low-connectivity environment was neither a disadvantage nor a limitation if they could receive localized, tailored services.\nBeing online is a privilege First of all, not everyone enjoys the online environment. More than 25% of the global population still doesn't use the internet1, and the disconnected population can reach around 80% in low-income countries, like Malawi2.\nThat's why we need a different approach to achieve a similar goal. Education, for example, cannot rely on tablets, Zoom, or Google Docs in many parts of the world, yet we can still deliver a remote learning experience through low-tech applications like USSD.\nLearning initiatives fail when we apply the rules of the hyper-connected world to the disconnected world without adapting to its context.\nHands-on needs are in the field Moreover, context adaptation is only possible based on an accurate, vivid understanding of the context, which requires extensive fieldwork and interviews. It is an in-person process of learning who, where, which, why, what, and how a certain problem emerges and evolves."

    "Description": "Speculative decoding is a technique which uses a fast draft model to accelerate the inference of a slow target model. With the right verification procedure, speculative decoding can be lossless (i.e. it reproduces the quality of the target model). For token-by-token verification procedures, the criteria for lossless decoding can be written as a system of linear equations and inequalities. The acceptance rate, which directly controls model throughput, is also linear in the same variables. Thus, the optimal verification procedure is obtained by solving a linear program. This linear program is equivalent to an optimal transport problem from the draft distribution to the target distribution."
