You can focus on glue work: process-based work that makes everyone around you more successful. You can join the conversation with your product manager and designer colleagues to influence what gets built, not just how it gets built. You can climb the ladder to staff engineer and above, or you can take it easy and focus on your hobbies. But whichever of these you choose, you have to know how tech companies work."

Here’s how I pruned it back to 1.1GB without breaking conversation continuity.\nThis also broke ccs - my fuzzy finder for Claude conversations. Parsing 3GB JSONL files was taking forever. I’ve since added --max-size filtering to ccs (defaults to 1GB), but that just hides the problem. Better to prune the files themselves."
