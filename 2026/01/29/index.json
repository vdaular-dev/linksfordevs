Except instead of seeing a rabbit or your Aunt\n                Martha’s profile, you start seeing intentions. Purpose.\n                A logic that surely must be there, that has to be there,\n                because someone—or something—wrote it with some goal in\n                mind. The problem is when that something is a language\n                model and the goal was simply to generate the most\n                probable sequence of characters given an input, which,\n                if you stop to think about it with the seriousness it\n                deserves, is a rather disturbing way to create the\n                instructions that will move money, control systems,\n                decide things."
