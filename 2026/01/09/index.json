    "Description": "For the past decade, I've used Mailhog for local email debugging. Besides working on web applications that deal with email, I've long used email as the primary notification system for comments on the blog.\nI built an Ansible role for Mailhog, and it was one of the main features of Drupal VM, a popular local development environment for Drupal I sunset 3 years ago.\nUnfortunately, barring any future updates from the maintainers, it seems like Mailhog has not been maintained for four years now. It still works, but something as complex as an email debugging environment needs ongoing maintenance to stay relevant."

    "Description": "Growing up, I was relentlessly encouraged to excel. From my first steps into the “academic realm” - if one can even grace first grade with such a title—I was conditioned to equate my worth with my report card. Being a naturally curious child, I succeeded, though likely less due to innate brilliance and more because of a deep-seated thirst for achievement.\nMy parents were the children of immigrants who had been stripped of their own educational opportunities. One grandparent survived the horrors of Auschwitz; the others endured similarly harrowing circumstances during the war. In their homes, education wasn’t a luxury—it was an impossibility. Consequently, my parents grew up with little academic guidance, eventually finding themselves in blue-collar roles that left them feeling financially precarious."
