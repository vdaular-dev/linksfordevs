    "Description": "How Replacing Developers With AI is Going Horribly Wrong\n\nIn recent years, many predicted that artificial intelligence would replace most software developers by the mid-2020s. However, evidence from 2024 and 2025 shows the opposite trend: companies are rehiring developers after realizing AI’s limitations. \n\nWhile AI tools can speed up simple and repetitive tasks, their performance declines in real production environments. Studies reveal that AI-generated code is more repetitive, less robust, and significantly more vulnerable to security flaws. \n\nSenior developers often lose productivity correcting AI output. High-profile failures and security incidents demonstrate that AI cannot replace human judgment, but can only support developers by handling routine tasks.\n\n\nCHAPTERS:\n0:18 Developer Hiring\n1:47 Tech Layoffs\n2:05 Software Jobs\n2:42 Job Market Shift\n3:10 AI And Employment\n3:55 Tech Workforce\n4:28 Engineering Roles\n5:06 Developer Demand\n6:12 Automation Impact\n7:48 Tech Job Market\n\nExecutive Producer: Danny Pasquel\nProduced by: Samantha Harvey\nEdited by: Jacob Smith\nAnimation: Charlotte Brown\nAdditional Footage: Getty Images\n\n» Subscribe to Economy Media: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc8q4B1bj-668LMHyNXnTxQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\nConect With Economy Media Everywhere\nFollow Economy Media on Instagram: https://n9.cl/economymedia\n\n#economymedia #ai #tech"
