But solar systems in the UK generate 15% to 20% of their summer output in the winter and obviously our electricity use is much higher in the winter.  A customer asked me how could they save that lovely spare summer energy for the winter.  They were asking if there's a way we could 'bank' their solar generated energy to then draw from in the winter.One answer is store it instead of exporting "

    "Description": "Profilers measure the performance of a whole program to identify where most of the time is spent. But once you’ve found a target function, re-profiling the whole program to see if your changes helped can be slow and cumbersome. The profiler introduces overhead to execution and you have to pick out the stats for the one function you care about from the report. I have often gone through this loop while optimizing client or open source projects, such as when I optimized Django’s system checks framework (previous post)."
