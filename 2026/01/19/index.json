As I was perusing the articles talking about different features and capabilities, and best ways to use it, I stumbled upon a section in Claude Code: Best practices for agentic coding, which states:\nb. Use Claude as a linter Claude Code can provide subjective code reviews beyond what traditional linting tools detect, identifying issues like typos, stale comments, misleading function or variable names, and more."

    "Description": "The scale of the cheating crisis in higher education is staggering. Depending on the survey, between 60% and 92% of college students now regularly use AI for their coursework. Professors are ill-equipped, and administrators are broadly turning a blind eye to the entire situation. Treating this as wholly the fault of AI is, however, a grave mistake.\nThe truth is that education has been broken for a long time, and AI was the accelerant that made the bonfire bright enough to see from a distance. In a system where degrees now primarily function as an expensive IQ screening mechanism, where learning is wholly secondary to certification, and where industrial-age teaching methods clash with information-age realities, AI has finally revealed the plastered-over fractures that have been growing for decades."

You can find both on smoltools, my collection of quick utilities I build for myself and throw online."
