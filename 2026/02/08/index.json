    "Description": "Large tech companies operate via systems. What that means is that the main outcomes - up to and including the overall success or failure of the company - are driven by a complex network of processes and incentives. These systems are outside the control of any particular person. Like the parts of a large codebase, they have accumulated and co-evolved over time, instead of being designed from scratch."

In fact, the rate at which it is changing is probably the most drastic element of it – I can't recall any time since my first year of college, twenty years ago, that I've experienced such a rapid evolution in my own ability to do stuff.  This week I have written a fully self-contained system monitoring daemon and terminal UI, as well as custom Rust firmware for the Ulanzi TC001 desktop clock.  These are two projects that would have remained ideas, never making it out of my notes folder."
