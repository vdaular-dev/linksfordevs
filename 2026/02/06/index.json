    "Description": "Postman just announced its March 2026 updates, and it’s a massive change and deviation from its original purpose as an API testing and documentation tool. In my opinion, the evolution of Postman, from a simple tool running locally to assist developers to build and test APIs into a complex cloud-based platform is a textbook example…"
