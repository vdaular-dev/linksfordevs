What looks contradictory from a single frame often reveals coherence when allowed to rotate over time. This essay uses the geometry of higher dimensions to explore why certainty fractures complex things, and why humility toward incomplete views is not weakness but structural necessity."

    "Description": "Dyslexia is a difference in the way the brain processes language. It is often defined as the difference between intelligence (vaguely defined via the fake IQ test) and a person's ability to read. That is, a dyslexic with normal intelligence will underperform compared to their peers in learning how to read. There are many different theories on what the cause is, but most people believe that there are fundamental differences between the brains of people who have dyslexia and those that do not. In Maryanne Wolf's book, Dyslexia, Fluency, and the Brain, several essays point to a physical difference in the density of specialized brain cells that the brain uses to process letter shapes. It has become clear recently from fMRIs that dyslexics actually develop unique neural pathways for reading that are located in the right side of the brain compared to the normal left-side-dominated reading pathways. However, a root cause has not been identified, and the jury is still out. Dyslexia varies considerably, with up to 15% of the population experiencing some form of it."

Tech people and tech companies do this on accident and on purpose, both because it can be useful to reduce a human concept to something simpler to quantify and because its easier to market and sell. Machine Learning, an academic term, becomes Artificial Intelligence and the word \"Intelligence\" is defined down in order to be achievable."
