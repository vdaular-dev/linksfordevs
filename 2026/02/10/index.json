    "Title": "A Benchmark for Evaluating Outcome-Driven Constraint Violations in Autonomous AI Agents",
    "Url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20798",
    "Timestamp": "2026-02-10T10:02:12",
    "Domain": "arxiv.org",
    "Description": "As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments, ensuring their safety and alignment with human values has become a paramount concern. Current safety benchmarks primarily evaluate whether agents refuse explicitly harmful instructions or whether they can maintain procedural compliance in complex tasks. However, there is a lack of benchmarks designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at 71.4%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant \"deliberative misalignment\", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world."

It houses all sorts of containers, but happily handles almost everything I throw at it, including Home Assistant, an MQTT instance, Predbat, Smokeping etc. etc.\nThis little stack of 4 Dell thin clients sits on the corner of my desk, each being powered via a single USB power supply - this means it only takes up a single power socket under the desk for neatness. Each node is also connected to a single Ubiquiti 5 port POE switch (USW-Flex), which again means no plug sockets being used up under the desk (but of course requires a POE switch to power it elsewhere…). Lovely and neat! Each node has two 8GB sticks of RAM, and I’ve replaced the M.2 WiFi cards with M.2 to NVME adapters to all me to expand the local storage.\n"
