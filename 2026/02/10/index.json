It houses all sorts of containers, but happily handles almost everything I throw at it, including Home Assistant, an MQTT instance, Predbat, Smokeping etc. etc.\nThis little stack of 4 Dell thin clients sits on the corner of my desk, each being powered via a single USB power supply - this means it only takes up a single power socket under the desk for neatness. Each node is also connected to a single Ubiquiti 5 port POE switch (USW-Flex), which again means no plug sockets being used up under the desk (but of course requires a POE switch to power it elsewhere…). Lovely and neat! Each node has two 8GB sticks of RAM, and I’ve replaced the M.2 WiFi cards with M.2 to NVME adapters to all me to expand the local storage.\n"
