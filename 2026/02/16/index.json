In this post, I walk through how I deploy, secure, back up, and monitor it — and why I still prefer owning the stack over using a managed platform."

Thankfully the attendees are all active professionals working in tech, the discussions are grounded in hands-on experience with AI tools, avoiding much of the hype. Below is the summit agenda:\nAs a software engineer at Google working on the Photos mobile clients’ editing features, I’m lucky to not worry about the token budget in terms of costs and can freely use Gemini models and Google AI tools for my work. It was both scary and comforting to learn that engineers at other places are struggling with the same challenges as me right now. Mainly:"

We had a discussion about the morality of not disclosing that it was an AI driven pull request up front, but what was pretty clear was that the quality was surprisingly high. Since I have a project with extensive documentation that I’ve spelled checked thoroughly this interested me. I write all the documentation with PyCharm which has built in spelling and grammar checks, so I was thinking it would be hard to find many errors."
