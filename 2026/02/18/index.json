They probably get a lot less tech support calls from people locking themselves out. I’m slightly annoyed about waiting 15 minutes for the DHCP lease list to update, but not annoyed enough to do anything about it. $60/month gets me 2 gbps up/down. That’s a great deal even if it means I can’t customize much."

We're far from reaching AI-assisted programming's final form, but it's already clear that the majority of code produced will no longer involve a human typing it out. For some people that's an uncontroversial and obvious statement. Others will dismiss it as overhyping AI's utility.  Irrespective of where you fall on the pro-AI vs anti-AI spectrum, the change can be deeply unsettling when, until now, your job has been to write the code that AI is now generating."
