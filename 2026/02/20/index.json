    "Description": "By Ljubisa Bajic Many believe AI is the real deal. In narrow domains, it already surpasses human performance. Used well, it is an unprecedented amplifier of human ingenuity and productivity. Its widespread adoption is hindered by two key barriers: high latency and astronomical cost. Interactions with language models lag far..."

We show, by deriving an exact gradient-based algorithm that propagates error forward in time (in multiple phases), that this does not necessarily need to be the case! However, while the math holds up, it suffers from critical numerical stability issues as the network forgets information faster.\nThis post details the derivation, the successful experiments, an analysis of why this promising idea suffers numerically, and the reasons why we did not investigate it further."
