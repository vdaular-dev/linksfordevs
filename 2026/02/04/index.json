    "Description": "We’ve recently been looking into optimizing rendering performance of the Perfetto UI on large traces. We discovered that there was some inefficiency in our data fetching logic, especially when you’re very zoomed out.\nIn this case, there can be a lot of slices (spans) which are so small that they take less than one pixel of width. So for each pixel, we need to figure out “what is the event which we should draw for this pixel”. Over time we’ve come to the conclusion that the best thing to draw is the slice with the largest duration in that pixel.\nWe can break this into two sub-problems:\nWhat is the range of events which correspond to each pixel? What is the event with the maximum duration for that pixel? We’re going to focus on 1) in this post as that’s where the slowdown was. 2) is fascinating but also surprisingly orthogonal. If you’re interested, I would suggest reading this excellent post from Tristan Hume explaining the basic algorithm we use."

I can’t help but be attracted to the absolute gonzo yolo mentality that birthed it, but I wouldn’t want to live there.   It’s been rattling around in my head since. He’s right on both counts. And I say that as someone who actually lives there.  The main thing I keep noticing isn’t the tools. It’s where the work goes.  Over the last six months living in Gas Town, the biggest shift hasn’t been speed, it’s attention. This post is about how that attention moves upstream into design and guardrails, and how the feedback loops change once you stop reading every line."
