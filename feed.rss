      <description>Let's take the case that hit me this morning. I've been working on ocaml-docs-ci in order to bring the exciting new odoc 3 features to ocaml.org for everyone to enjoy. I have it checked out and building locally, but to deploy it to the infrastructure managed by Mark Elvers it needs to be packaged up into a Docker image. So I issued the usual docker build . and after it churned through the setup stages and got on to building the project, it hit an error:</description>

      <description>I always had strong opinions about the value of craftsmanship, and of product as a kind of fake replica of craft.

      <title>Making Rails Global IDs safer</title>
      <link>https://blog.julik.nl/2025/12/a-trap-with-global-ids</link>
      <description>The new LLM world is very exciting, and I try to experiment with the new tools when I can. This includes building agentic applications, one of which is my personal accounting and invoicing tool - that I wrote about previously As part of that effort I started experimenting with RubyLLM to have some view into items in my system. And while I have used a neat pattern for referencing objects in the application from the tool calls - the Rails Global ID system - it turned out to be quite treacherous. So, let’s have a look at where GlobalID may bite you, and examine alternatives and tweaks we can do. What are Rails GIDs? The Rails global IDs (“GIDs”) are string handles to a particular model in a Rails application. Think of it like a model URL. They usually have the form of gid://awesome-app/Post/32. That comprises: The name of your app (roughly what you passed in when doing rails new) The class name of the model The primary key of the model You can grab a model in your application and get a global ID for it: moneymaker(dev):001&gt; Invoice.last.to_global_id Invoice Load (0.3ms) SELECT "invoices".* FROM "invoices" ORDER BY "invoices"."id" DESC LIMIT 1 /*application='Moneymaker'*/ =&gt; #&lt;GlobalID:0x00000001415978a0 @uri=#&lt;URI::GID gid://moneymaker/Invoice/161&gt;&gt; Rails uses those GIDs primarily in ActiveJob serialization. When you do DebitFundsJob.perform_later(customer) where the customer is your Customer model object which is stored in the DB, ActiveJob won’t serialize its attributes but instead serialize it as a “handle” - the global ID. When your job gets deserialized from the queue, the global ID is going to get resolved into a SELECT and your perform method will get the resulting Customer model as argument. All very neat. And dangerous, sometimes - once LLMs become involved.</description>

      <title>AcroByte - Acronym word game</title>
      <link>https://blog.gametje.com/posts/2025-11-30/</link>
      <description>This “new” game has a special place in my heart. It’s a re-imagining of a game I played all the time in high school back in the early 2000s. Late nights spent with friends pre-cable internet. Using our AOL connections and firing up Acrophobia. Making inside jokes and coming up with clever acronyms to make each other laugh (and hopefully score points too!). I actually wrote a version of this back in 2017 as part of my prototypes that came before Gametje. This one is luckily far more polished visually and with proper gameplay mechanics. Meet AcroByte:</description>

      <description>I hate waiting for compilations. For day-to-day it may only be a minute or two, but once you start doing another task, the context switching distracts from what you were doing before and breaks everything up. Life is too short to be waiting for computers.</description>
