      <title>The Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05117</link>
      <description>We show that deep neural networks trained across diverse tasks exhibit remarkably similar low-dimensional parametric subspaces. We provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that demonstrates that neural networks systematically converge to shared spectral subspaces regardless of initialization, task, or domain. Through mode-wise spectral analysis of over 1100 models - including 500 Mistral-7B LoRAs, 500 Vision Transformers, and 50 LLaMA-8B models - we identify universal subspaces capturing majority variance in just a few principal directions. By applying spectral decomposition techniques to the weight matrices of various architectures trained on a wide range of tasks and datasets, we identify sparse, joint subspaces that are consistently exploited, within shared architectures across diverse tasks and datasets. Our findings offer new insights into the intrinsic organization of information within deep networks and raise important questions about the possibility of discovering these universal subspaces without the need for extensive data and computational resources. Furthermore, this inherent structure has significant implications for model reusability, multi-task learning, model merging, and the development of training and inference-efficient algorithms, potentially reducing the carbon footprint of large-scale neural models.</description>

      <title>Is Vibe Coding Safe? Benchmarking Vulnerability of Agent-Generated Code in Real-World Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03262</link>
      <description>Vibe coding is a new programming paradigm in which human engineers instruct large language model (LLM) agents to complete complex coding tasks with little supervision. Although it is increasingly adopted, are vibe coding outputs really safe to deploy in production? To answer this question, we propose SU S VI B E S, a benchmark consisting of 200 feature-request software engineering tasks from real-world open-source projects, which, when given to human programmers, led to vulnerable implementations. We evaluate multiple widely used coding agents with frontier models on this benchmark. Disturbingly, all agents perform poorly in terms of software security. Although 61% of the solutions from SWE-Agent with Claude 4 Sonnet are functionally correct, only 10.5% are secure. Further experiments demonstrate that preliminary security strategies, such as augmenting the feature request with vulnerability hints, cannot mitigate these security issues. Our findings raise serious concerns about the widespread adoption of vibe-coding, particularly in security-sensitive applications.</description>

      <title>Satisficing for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://www.alephic.com/writing/satisficing-for-llms</link>
      <description>By applying Herbert Simon’s concept of satisficing to AI, this post argues that language models might prefer logical‐sounding content over emotional appeals, mirroring human biases but inverted. It unveils a paradox: humans use emotion to decide rationally, while LLMs use pseudo‐rational style to appear helpful.</description>

      <title>The secure open source fallacy</title>
      <link>https://ulveon.net/p/2025-12-03-the-secure-open-source-fallacy/</link>
      <description>Most open source advocates, and many security professionals, often say things like “open source software is secure because you can just read the code”.
This argument assumes that the ability to read source code directly translates into the ability to understand, verify, and trust it, because you can see the files this software opens or the network sockets it listens on. You can see the kind of network data it sends, and the cryptography it uses.

      <title>Jepsen: NATS 2.12.1</title>
      <link>https://jepsen.io/analyses/nats-2.12.1</link>
      <description>NATS is a distributed streaming system. Regular NATS streams offer only best-effort delivery, but a subsystem, called JetStream, guarantees messages are delivered at least once. We tested NATS JetStream, version 2.12.1, and found that it lost writes if data files were truncated or corrupted on a minority of nodes. We also found that coordinated power failures, or an OS crash on a single node combined with network delays or process pauses, can cause the loss of committed writes and persistent split-brain. This data loss was caused (at least in part) by choosing to flush writes to disk every two minutes, rather than before acknowledging them. We also include a belated note on data loss due to process crashes in version 2.10.22, which was fixed in 2.10.23. NATS has now documented the risk of its default fsync policy, and the remaining issues remain under investigation. This research was performed independently by Jepsen, without compensation, and conducted in accordance with the Jepsen ethics policy.</description>

      <description>In this tutorial, I show a better method for breaking up tiling artifacts so terrain looks more organic and less repetitive. I show how to create the technique in both Unreal and Unity.

Here's the original technique demonstrated by Inigo Quilez on ShaderToy:

      <title>New GPU Profiler and RHI Submission Pipeline | Unreal Fest Stockholm 2025</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=vnbARZHccpQ</link>
      <description>In this session recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm, we take a look at the new features of the improved GPU profiler that shipped with UE 5.6, and how the extra information it provides can help when profiling titles for both CPU and GPU performance. 

We also take a deep dive on our modern RHI submission pipeline design. This system is responsible for the threading of renderer work on the CPU, and feeding that work to the GPU. 

Watch to learn about the modern Unreal Engine renderer threading design, which is valuable when analysing Unreal Insights traces for rendering related performance issues.
