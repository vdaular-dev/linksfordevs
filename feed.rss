      <title>The (lazy) Git UI You Didn't Know You Need</title>
      <link>https://www.bwplotka.dev/2025/lazygit/</link>
      <description>When my son was born last April, I had ambitious learning plans for the upcoming 5w paternity leave. As you can imagine, with two kids, life quickly verified this plan 🙃. I did eventually start some projects. One of the goals (sounding rebellious in the current AI hype cycle) was to learn and use neovim for coding. As a Goland aficionado, I (and my wrist) have always been tempted by no-mouse, OSS, gopls based, highly configurable dev setups.</description>

      <title>Learning Biology as a Software Developer</title>
      <link>https://pablofarias.com/learning-biology-as-a-software-developer/</link>
      <description>After 30 years of programming and with all the annoying AI madness I felt like learning something entirely new.

With biohacking being a huge interest of mine for the past couple of years, I decided to take on the challenge to learn the basics of biology.

      <title>Builder Design Pattern and Cyclomatic Complexity Reduction</title>
      <link>https://johnjr.dev/posts/builder-design-pattern-and-cyclomatic-complexity-reduction/</link>
      <description>In this post, I will explain in detail how I used the builder design pattern together with the bit mask field technique to reduce complexity. As a result, I decreased the cyclomatic complexity from 24 to 0 and reduced development time from hours to minutes.
The rest of this post is organized as follows sections:

The problem explains the problem I was solving.
Creating the bit mask field presents a solution to the problem.
Cyclomatic Complexity discusses cyclomatic complexity and calculates this metric for the solution presented in the section above.
Builder design pattern explains the builder design pattern and describes the refactoring process that removed complexity.
Conclusion summarizes this post.
References provides references related to the topics discussed here.

All the examples shown here are in C++.</description>

      <link>https://mihaiolteanu.me/dull-days-at-the-factory</link>
      <description>"Can you design the electrical wiring for this conference room?" J, my
                future boss asks me. Back in college, we designed the electrical wiring
                for a whole factory. This is just a small conference room with two
                lightbulbs. But I've finished my Electrical Engineering studies three
                months ago and all I got is rejections. I am by now experienced in the
                arts of the technical interview. I can look the audience in the eye and
                give them what they want. "Oh no, of course not!" I reply and we all laugh
                stupidly about it. Both J and his boss like my answer. It's 2008 and I'm
                officially an engineer.</description>

      <link>https://heatherburns.tech/2025/11/10/time-to-start-de-appling/</link>
      <description>I‘ve done such a thorough job of de-Googling that I forgot to show up for a meeting with someone, because I hadn’t checked my Google calendar in ages. (No, they were not amused.) In my defense, I proceeded to explain to them that having de-Googled, I was also in the process of de-Appling, which is a special bonus level that those of us in the UK have unlocked.</description>
