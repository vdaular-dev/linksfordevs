      <title>Bundler belongs to the Ruby community</title>
      <link>https://andre.arko.net/2025/09/25/bundler-belongs-to-the-ruby-community/</link>
      <description>I’ve spent 15 years of my life working on Bundler. When I introduce myself, people say “oh, the Bundler guy?”, and I am forced to agree.
I didn’t come up with the original idea for Bundler (that was Yehuda). I also didn’t work on the first six months worth of prototypes. That was all Carl and Yehuda together, back when “Carlhuda” was a super-prolific author of Ruby libraries, including most of the work to modularize Rails for version 3.</description>

      <title>Redis is fast - I'll cache in Postgres</title>
      <link>https://dizzy.zone/2025/09/24/Redis-is-fast-Ill-cache-in-Postgres/</link>
      <description>There are books &amp; many articles online, like this one arguing for using Postgres for everything. I thought I’d take a look at one use case - using Postgres instead of Redis for caching. I work with APIs quite a bit, so I’d build a super simple HTTP server that responds with data from that cache. I’d start from Redis as this is something I frequently encounter at work, switch it out to Postgres using unlogged tables and see if there’s a difference.</description>

      <title>VassiLife</title>
      <link>https://vassi.life/projects/diffinetune</link>
      <description>In this small project, the goal is to learn a bit the world of finetuning/creating LoRA's with diffusion models. Indeed, I did a bit of pre-training, both for LLMs and diffusion models, but I have not experimented much with finetuning yet. The idea for this project is then to fine-tune a diffusion model to include my face in the generated images. Then, I can generate a bunch in different wacky situations/styles, and randomize then in the first page of the website, including the caption used to generate it. Of course, by now models are so big and smart that finetuning to do this is quite overkill: I could simply provide my picture to chatGPT, and ask it to incorporate it in some images, and it would probably work better. Still, its a good learning opportunity, which is as usual the main goal of my projects.</description>

      <link>https://noteflakes.com/articles/2025-09-23-euruko</link>
      <description>I’ve just got back home from Euruko last night. The conference ended on Friday,
but I decided to stay two more nights in Portugal and visit Porto. In between
walking all over the city, eating great food and enjoying the dancing and music
making in the street, I’ve also had time to think about all the wonderful people
I met at the conference (and even some I’ve met and talked to by chance on the
streets of Viana do Castelo and Porto), and the incredible experiences I’ve had
at Euruko.</description>
