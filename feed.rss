      <title>ANARI - Cross-Platform 3D Rendering Engine API</title>
      <link>https://www.khronos.org/anari/</link>
      <description>ANARI significantly simplifies the development of applications in domains such as scientific
                    visualization by providing high-level functionality to build an in-memory scene representation to be
                    rendered without need for low-level graphics code, and enabling the use of any 3D rendering engine
                    that supports the ANARI API. ANARI has already been widely integrated into scientific visualizati</description>

      <description>If you're not caught up on the current hypewave, coding agents like Claude Code and Cursor have latched onto skills recently. Like with all of these waves, everyone has immediately proclaimed they solve all problems, and all previous iterations of technology are no longer relevant. That's obviously not true, and I want to talk about my thinking behind them.</description>

      <title>Why Offline Learning Still Matters in 2026</title>
      <link>https://takuti.me/note/offline-learning/</link>
      <description>Short answer: There are two extremes in our world—hyper-connected world of rich countries, and a disconnected world of underserved communities like rural Africa.
I've seen both, and I conclude that being in a low-resource and low-connectivity environment was neither a disadvantage nor a limitation if they could receive localized, tailored services.
Being online is a privilege First of all, not everyone enjoys the online environment. More than 25% of the global population still doesn't use the internet1, and the disconnected population can reach around 80% in low-income countries, like Malawi2.
That's why we need a different approach to achieve a similar goal. Education, for example, cannot rely on tablets, Zoom, or Google Docs in many parts of the world, yet we can still deliver a remote learning experience through low-tech applications like USSD.
Learning initiatives fail when we apply the rules of the hyper-connected world to the disconnected world without adapting to its context.
Hands-on needs are in the field Moreover, context adaptation is only possible based on an accurate, vivid understanding of the context, which requires extensive fieldwork and interviews. It is an in-person process of learning who, where, which, why, what, and how a certain problem emerges and evolves.</description>

      <title>Speculative Decoding Is Not a Heuristic – Reed Meyerson</title>
      <link>https://reedmeyerson.com/posts/speculative_decoding_not_heuristic/</link>
      <description>Speculative decoding is a technique which uses a fast draft model to accelerate the inference of a slow target model. With the right verification procedure, speculative decoding can be lossless (i.e. it reproduces the quality of the target model). For token-by-token verification procedures, the criteria for lossless decoding can be written as a system of linear equations and inequalities. The acceptance rate, which directly controls model throughput, is also linear in the same variables. Thus, the optimal verification procedure is obtained by solving a linear program. This linear program is equivalent to an optimal transport problem from the draft distribution to the target distribution.</description>

      <title>Best Practices for Ownership in GLib</title>
      <link>https://blog.sebastianwick.net/posts/glib-ownership-best-practices/</link>
      <description>For all the rightful criticisms that C gets, GLib does manage to alleviate at least some of it. If we can’t use a better language, we should at least make use of all the tools we have in C with GLib.
This post looks at the topic of ownership, and also how it applies to libdex fibers.
Ownership In normal C usage, it is often not obvious at all if an object that gets returned from a function (either as a real return value or as an out-parameter) is owned by the caller or the callee:</description>

      <title>Are We All Forced Meme Stock Investors Now?</title>
      <link>https://idiallo.com/byte-size/we-are-all-meme-stock-investers-now?src=feed</link>
      <description>Let's be honest, the financial landscape feels… weird lately. For years, the mantra for most investors has been clear: diversify, buy stable index funds, and let time work its magic. It wasn't the most thrilling advice, but it was generally sound. The idea was that the underlying fundamentals of the economy and the companies within it would eventually drive long-term returns.</description>

      <title>Douglas Adams on the English–American cultural divide over “heroes”</title>
      <link>https://shreevatsa.net/post/douglas-adams-cultural-divide/</link>
      <description>In 2000, Douglas Adams made an interesting observation that I keep returning to.
A user on Slashdot named “FascDot Killed My Pr” had asked the following question (where HGttG = Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy):
Comedy….or Tragedy?
First, a big thank-you. You’ve made a lasting contribution to “our” culture (or should that be “culture”?)
I first read HGttG in my early teens. I doubled over laughing the whole time. I read and reread the entire series, bought both Dirk Gently books AND Last Chance to See. Loved them all and wouldn’t trade having read them for anything. (btw, the first mental ward scene in Long Dark Teatime is a no-foolin’, all-time classic.)</description>
