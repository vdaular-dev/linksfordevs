      <description>For as long as I have published my books, one of my overarching goals was to give credit to those who actually invented the hardware and software that we use.

I have spent 10,000+ hours to create an accurate record of their work but I'm not complaining. The 'as-close-to-possible'</description>

      <title>Hetzner Servers Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://softuts.com/hetzner-servers-benchmarks/</link>
      <description>* EDITED: 4 November 2025 - Added EX63 benchmarks

I wanted to quickly compare how different Hetzner servers are doing (especially in single-threaded), for CPU-intensive tasks.

I ran sysbench on four different machines:

 * Hetzner Cloud CPX21 (AMD EPYC Processor, 3vCPU, 4GB RAM) ~9EUR/mo
 * Hetzner Dedicated EX44 (i5-13500, 64GB RAM) ~40EUR/</description>

      <title>Coding Agents Are Outliers</title>
      <link>https://vivekhaldar.com/articles/coding-agents-are-outliers/</link>
      <description>If you look at the agent landscape today, one of the most prominent success stories has been software coding agents, particularly the quantum leap since the CLI coding agents came out, starting with Claude Code in early 2025. While people were certainly using LLMs for various coding tasks before these CLI agents, this new form factor offered a compelling set of functionality not available before. They can write complex code, debug tricky issues, refactor entire codebases, and even deploy applications.</description>

      <title>Disaggregated Inference: 18 Months Later</title>
      <link>https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/blogs/distserve-retro/</link>
      <description>Eighteen months ago, our lab introduced DistServe with a simple bet: split LLM inference into prefill and decode, and scale them independently on separate compute pools. Today, almost every production-grade LLM serving framework – NVIDIA Dynamo, llm-d, SGLang, vLLM, LMCache, MoonCake – runs on disaggregation and demonstrates its power in large-scale, real-world LLM serving workloads, with many more continuing to push its boundaries. Concepts like TTFT (time-to-first-token) and TPOT (time-per-output-token), now standard latency metrics in nearly every serving benchmark, were also popularized through the lens of disaggregation.</description>

      <title>Resurrecting valuable expired domains</title>
      <link>https://blog.mbrt.dev/posts/domain-resurrect/</link>
      <description>I processed a large fraction of the Internet on a single machine, trying to find some valuable but forgotten domain names to buy (probably 25 years too late). Here’s the story of what I found and how I did it, and not the story of why I decided to try, because I don’t know myself.
Spoiler alert: If you just want to know whether there is indeed something, and you should scramble to scoop it up to become a domain-flipper billionaire, hold your horses: I believe there isn’t much. The following sections are more focused on the engineering side, so if you only care about the conclusion, skip to Results.</description>
