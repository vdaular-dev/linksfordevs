      <description>Recently, the application of AI tools to Erdos problems passed a milestone: an Erdos problem (#728 https://www.erdosproblems.com/728) was solved more or less autonomously by AI (after some feedback from an initial attempt), in the spirit of the problem (as reconstructed by the Erdos problem website community), with the result (to the best of our knowledge) not replicated in existing literature (although similar results proven by similar methods were located).

This is a demonstration of the genuine increase in capability of these tools in recent months, and is largely consistent with other recent demonstrations of AI using existing methods to resolve Erdos problems, although in most previous cases a solution to these problems was later located in the literature, as discussed in https://mathstodon.xyz/deck/@tao/115788262274999408 .  This particular case was unusual in that the problem as stated by Erdos was misformulated, with a reconstruction of the problem in the intended spirit only obtained in the last few months, which helps explain the lack of prior literature on the problem.  However, I would like to talk here about another aspect of the story which I find more interesting than the solution itself, which is the emerging AI-powered capability to rapidly write and rewrite expositions of the solution.

      <title>Why Claude Code feels different</title>
      <link>https://www.nvegater.com/blog/ClaudeCodeAdvantage</link>
      <description>Claude Code shows me an unusual ability across massive and complex codebases, while others struggle despite using the same base models.
I use many coding tools daily: Claude Code, Cursor, Jetbrains AI, Antigravity, Zed, and Warp. I won't go into detail about each one of the use cases, but across all of them, Claude Code is consistently better.</description>

      <link>https://yoav.blog/2026/01/09/claude-code-sessions-should-be-encrypted/</link>
      <description>Claude Code is exploding in popularity right now, and people are using it for much more than writing code.
Everyone should be using Claude Code more
PMs, marketers, designers, founders, parents. Everyone.
The trick is to forget that it’s called Claude Code and instead think of it as Claude Local or Claude Agent. It’s essentially a super-intelligent AI running locally, able to do… pic.twitter.com/F6iDwYPMRY
— Lenny Rachitsky (@lennysan) October 14, 2025 Whether it’s to manage your email, write peer performance feedback, or even be your Chief of Staff—people are putting sensitive, personal information into Claude Code. And the more we use it for non-coding work, the more the session files are valuable and private1.</description>

      <link>https://andreyor.st/posts/2026-01-09-slopes-in-aabb-collision-systems/</link>
      <description>Recently (again, bored on a vacation), I started working on a game I’ve planned for a long time. I wasn’t satisfied with my existing implementations of a player controller1, so I started working on a new one. After a bit of fiddling around, I came to something I’m satisfied with, for now, at least, but while working on it, I wanted to add something I haven’t done in any of my projects yet - I decided to add slopes to my game.</description>
