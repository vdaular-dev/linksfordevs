      <title>CVE-2025-59489: Arbitrary Code Execution in Unity Runtime</title>
      <link>https://flatt.tech/research/posts/arbitrary-code-execution-in-unity-runtime/</link>
      <description>Introduction Hello, I’m RyotaK (@ryotkak ), a security engineer at GMO Flatt Security Inc.
In May 2025, I participated in the Meta Bug Bounty Researcher Conference 2025. During this event, I discovered a vulnerability (CVE-2025-59489) in the Unity Runtime that affects games and applications built on Unity 2017.1 and later.
In this article, I will explain the technical aspects of this vulnerability and its impact.
This vulnerability was disclosed to Unity following responsible disclosure practices.
Unity has since released patches for Unity 2019.1 and later, as well as a Unity Binary Patch tool to address the issue, and I strongly encourage developers to download the updated versions of Unity, recompile affected games or applications, and republish as soon as possible.</description>

      <title>A Very Early History of Algebraic Data Types</title>
      <link>https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/algdt-history/</link>
      <description>Been quiet around here! I’ve been putting almost all of my writing time into Logic for Programmers and my whole brain is book-shaped. Trust me, you do not want to read my 2000-word rant on Sphinx post-build LaTeX customization. But I spent the past week in a historical rabbit hole and had to share what I found.
It started with Algebraic [Data] Types are not Scary, Actually. The post covers AlgDTs1 in more detail, but a quick overview is:</description>

      <title>How I Organize the Papers I Read</title>
      <link>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2025-10-03_reading_papers/</link>
      <description>I got asked how I manage papers, notes, and citations for doing research. I started writing out a very long Slack message, but it quickly passed the threshold where I ought to just turn it into a blog post.
The short of it: I’m an incorrigible Emacs user, so I do a lot through my editor of choice on my laptop. That said, Zotero is a fabulous piece of technology, and I rely on it heavily to get my work done.</description>

      <title>Talent is Alignment</title>
      <link>https://xlii.space/thoughts/talent-is-alignment/</link>
      <description>Przemysław Alexander Kamiński · Raideur des doigts
September 20th, 2025 marks exactly one year since I bought Roland’s
FPX-30, 88-keys full sized digital piano. Being in my 4th decade of
life I never taught myself any instrument, even though I own and dabble with many.
In fact, while I’m unable to remember sounds or hear them in my head,
it seems I have a rather good understanding what “sounds nice” that
allows me to ad-hoc compose music.</description>

      <title>» A Looking Glass Half Empty, Part 1: Just Lookin’ for a Hit The Digital Antiquarian</title>
      <link>https://www.filfre.net/2025/10/a-looking-glass-half-empty-part-1-just-lookin-for-a-hit/</link>
      <description>There was some discussion about it: “Wow, gosh, it’d sure be nice if we were making more money and selling more copies so we could do crazy games of the type we want, as opposed to having to worry about how we’re going to sell more.” Hey, I’d love it if the public was more into what I like to do and a little less into slightly more straightforward things. But I totally get that they’re into straightforward things. I don’t have any divine right to have someone hand me millions of dollars to make a game of whatever I want to do. At some fundamental level, everyone has a wallet, and they vote with it.</description>
