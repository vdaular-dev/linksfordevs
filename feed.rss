      <title>The path to ubiquitous AI | Taalas</title>
      <link>https://taalas.com/the-path-to-ubiquitous-ai/</link>
      <description>By Ljubisa Bajic Many believe AI is the real deal. In narrow domains, it already surpasses human performance. Used well, it is an unprecedented amplifier of human ingenuity and productivity. Its widespread adoption is hindered by two key barriers: high latency and astronomical cost. Interactions with language models lag far...</description>

      <title>Forward propagation of errors through time</title>
      <link>https://nicolaszucchet.github.io/Forward-propagation-errors-through-time/</link>
      <description>TL;DR
We investigate a fundamental question in recurrent neural network training: why is backpropagation through time always ran backwards? We show, by deriving an exact gradient-based algorithm that propagates error forward in time (in multiple phases), that this does not necessarily need to be the case! However, while the math holds up, it suffers from critical numerical stability issues as the network forgets information faster.
This post details the derivation, the successful experiments, an analysis of why this promising idea suffers numerically, and the reasons why we did not investigate it further.</description>

      <description>I've been running this website since 2008. Over the years I've changed hosting
providers and what software to use a bunch of times. Some time in 2015 I
switched to hosting it as a static website on Amazon
CloudFront. A few years ago I
moved from Amazon to Cloudflare, primarily because Cloudflare
Pages and Cloudflare
R2 have a generous free tier, and an interface
that isn't a confusing mess.</description>

The roads, the aqueducts, the legal system, the trade networks stretching from Britain to Mesopotamia: all of it seemed to be a near-fact of nature, like gravity // the Mediterranean itself.</description>

I don't actually mind AI-aided development, a tool is a tool and should be used if you find it useful, but I think the vibe coded Show HN projects are overall pretty boring. They generally don't have a lot of work put into them, and as a result, the author (pilot?</description>
