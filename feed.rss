      <description>Last year, all my non-programmer friends were building apps. Yet today, those apps are nowhere to be found.

      <title>2026-01-14: The Day the telnet Died – GreyNoise Labs</title>
      <link>https://www.labs.greynoise.io/grimoire/2026-02-10-telnet-falls-silent/</link>
      <description>On January 14, 2026, global telnet traffic observed by GreyNoise sensors fell off a cliff. A 59% sustained reduction, eighteen ASNs going completely silent, five countries vanishing from our data entirely. Six days later, CVE-2026-24061 dropped. Coincidence is one explanation.</description>

      <title>Hands-Free Claude Code with the Agent SDK</title>
      <link>https://yberreby.com/posts/hands-free-claude-code/</link>
      <description>I'm a decently heavy Claude Code user.
Running some usage stats by data mining ~/.claude and running ccusage,
it turns out that I average a few thousand messages per day,
and I ran through 2.72 billion tokens 
(2.63B of those being cache reads, thankfully)
over the past 42 days.
If I weren't using a Max plan,
this would amount to $1822 in API costs.</description>

      <link>https://mattbruenig.com/2026/02/10/technical-details-of-my-llm-generated-book/</link>
      <description>I released a book today called The National Labor Relations Book, which you can buy over at NLRBResearch.com for $10 (click here). The book provides an introduction to the NLRA and NLRB by providing summaries of the 100 most-cited cases in this area of law using the 100 most recent cases citing to each of those cases. Do the math and that’s 10,000 cases in total being digested and turned into a book.</description>

      <title>On screwing up</title>
      <link>https://www.seangoedecke.com/screwing-up/</link>
      <description>The most shameful thing I did in the workplace was lie to a colleague. It was about ten years ago, I was a fresh-faced intern, and in the rush to deliver something I’d skipped the step of testing my work in staging1. It did not work. When deployed to production, it didn’t work there either. No big deal, in general terms: the page we were working on wasn’t yet customer-facing. But my colleague asked me over his desk whether this worked when I’d tested it, and I said something like “it sure did, no idea what happened”.</description>

      <description>In 2025, Khronos reached an impressive milestone: 25 years of member-driven open standards development. The graphics, compute, and media landscape looked wildly different in 2000, when Khronos was formed, than it does today.  Era-defining technologies such as smartphones, cloud computing, and the metaverse hadn’t yet emerged into the marketplace. The founders of Khronos were on the forefront of these emerging technologies. They knew that withou</description>
