      <title>Mapgen4 river shader</title>
      <link>https://www.redblobgames.com/blog/2025-09-30-mapgen4-river-shader/</link>
      <description>Back in 2018 I had the idea to prerender short segments of river bends and confluences into a texture, and then use that texture to draw the rivers to the screen. I was trying to have draw exactly one triangle per Delaunay triangle, so that I could generate the geometry ahead of time and only change the texture coordinates. I planned to implement this[1] as a 2D table:</description>

      <title>Lottery economics -Louis-André Labadie</title>
      <link>https://louis-andre.net/journal/lottery-economics</link>
      <description>Where I live, the national loto company, Loto-Québec, regularly run campaigns reminding players to sign their tickets or scratch cards when they play. Ostensibly, this protects the winner – in some minimal way – but the back of every ticket is also a contract with Loto Québec. That contract states that, essentially, a winner is not entitled to receive their prize unless they allow Loto Québec to run news and ads featuring them.</description>

      <title>Development gets better with Age</title>
      <link>https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2025/10/better-with-age.html</link>
      <description>He has heard the whispers, “he is getting older, who will replace him?” People asking him with a straight face, “when will you retire?” After close to 25 years at Amazon, where each year has been different and amazing, He feels as young as the day he decided to leave academia and join Amazon.
The thing about getting older as a developer, is that you have seen a lot and encountered many of the problems younger developers are facing (even if they look a little different on first glance). If you’ve been around the block as many times as some of us have, you’ll have earned battle scars along the way. There are days in war rooms you will never forget. You have experimented a lot, and you have failed more times than you care to remember. You have half-a-head full of what is practical and works. And a quarter of that space has been trained to look for red flags, scanning for things that you know will go wrong.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered how hard it is to make an AI talk to an API? Wouldn’t it be great if I could talk to a machine like Captain Picard does to his computer?
“Tea. Earl Grey. Hot!” would have to sent to the replicator subsystem with the correct instructions. But how would that actually work? I suppose, the Starship Enterprise-D made its first appearance on the airwaves in 1987. So at the time I guess we could expect a replicator to be programmed in C.</description>
