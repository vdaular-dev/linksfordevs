      <link>https://blog.prizrak.me/post/landlock/</link>
      <description>Landlock is a Linux API that lets applications explicitly declare which resources they are allowed to access. Its philosophy is similar to OpenBSD’s unveil() and (less so) pledge(): programs can make a contract with the kernel stating, “I only need these files or resources — deny me everything else if I’m compromised.”</description>

      <title>Self-hosting my photos with Immich</title>
      <link>https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2025-11-29-self-hosting-photos-with-immich/</link>
      <description>For every cloud service I use, I want to have a local copy of my data for backup purposes and independence. Unfortunately, the gphotos-sync tool stopped working in March 2025 when Google restricted the OAuth scopes, so I needed an alternative for my existing Google Photos setup. In this post, I describe how I have set up Immich, a self-hostable photo manager.

      <title>Why I'm Shutting Down Lorelight (And What It Taught Me About GEO)</title>
      <link>https://growwithless.com/shutting-down-lorelight/</link>
      <description>I’m shutting down Lorelight.
Not because it didn’t work. Not because I ran out of money. But because I realized something that probably should have been obvious from the start.
Let me explain.
What Was Lorelight? A few months ago, I launched Lorelight—a generative engine optimization (GEO) platform designed to help businesses improve their visibility in AI search engines like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity.
The pitch was simple: as more people use AI to find information, brands need to optimize for these new platforms. Lorelight would track your brand mentions in ChatGPT, monitor visibility across AI-generated answers, and help you understand what was driving citations in AI search results.</description>

      <description>(a different frame for UAPs)

I was watching The Age of Disclosure the other night and got stuck at the point where they break down the "five observables": instant acceleration, no sonic boom, trans-medium travel, the whole suite of behaviors that make UAPs physically weird.

The standard debate is binary:</description>

      <description>I recently wrote about optimizing repos for AI, but I've not quite settled on the question of, _should_ you optimize repos for AI? That is, is there really substantial daylight between what an AI dev needs and what a human needs?</description>

      <title>"Courage to quit" matters more for seniors, less for juniors</title>
      <link>https://til.andrew-quinn.me/posts/courage-to-quit-matters-more-for-seniors-less-for-juniors/</link>
      <description>As a teenager first getting into computers in the late 2000s I spent a lot of
time reading old
revered tomes like
ESR’s The Art of Unix Programming
and
SICP
.
If present-day me were to isekai back in time and lose all of the technical
knowledge I had but retain my current instincts, however, I would have left
all of this on the table and just built a terrible new automation tool for
the surprisingly scriptable MMORPG I was into
in PHP 5, with as much disregard for clean code and security practices
that I could muster[^1].
Then I would have put that tool online, continued to add new features to the
ball of mud, and kept it running for 5-10 years before my first post-college
interview. And then the vibe that would come across is less “He’s an egghead,
and we like that, but we really need someone who actually does things” and
more “He’s a meathead, but inside of that meathead is an egghead waiting to
be revealed. We need this kind of junior dev yesterday.”
I would have done this even though
an objectively far superior tool
had already existed for quite some time,
making this project “feel like” dead weight in the wide world of software!
But why?</description>
