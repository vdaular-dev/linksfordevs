      <title>Return of the Obra Dinn - Narrated Modeling Mega Timelapse</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=90vqCKEEj3s</link>
      <description>Creating characters, objects, and scenes for "Return of the Obra Dinn" from 2015-2018
*CONTAINS HOURS OF SPOILERS AND DRONING NARRATION*

This timelapse shows all my 3D-related work on Obra Dinn, from May 2015 (one year after development started), up to the game's initial release in October 2018. The timelapse 3D data was captured during development using custom tools, then re-cammed and narrated after release to produce this exhausting video.

https://youtu.be/qZFoBvJf8Ug is a tastefully stylized presentation of this same 3D timelapse data, minus the character modeling/painting and the commentary.

      <description>My brother in law died in June. Heart attack. Four hours in the hospital and gone. And then the bills came. He’d let his insurance lapse two months prior. Bills were a few thousand here for the cardiologist, another few there for the ER docs, a bit for the radiologist. I helped my sister-in-law negotiate these down but they weren’t back breakers. Then the hospital bill came: $195k. This is a story about that.</description>

      <title>.NET Libraries Are Beyond Saving</title>

      <description>Check out my courses on Dometrain: https://dometrain.com/courses/?ref=nick-chapsas&amp;promo=youtube

Hello, everybody. I'm Nick, and in this video, I want to talk about the .NET Library ecosystem, focusing on open-source libraries specifically and talking about the different monetisation models that authors choose to adopt, as well as the idea that we can "save" open source projects by forking them.

Check out my workshops: https://dometrain.com/workshops/

      <link>https://arnon.dk/notes-on-where-seat-based-pricing-is-going/</link>
      <description>Everyone (mostly me) keeps saying seat pricing is dead, and some people are arguing with me online. I think that’s cool, but it’s because they don’t understand why it’s dying. For twenty years, SaaS revenue scaled with headcount.More humans = more seats.That logic held so long that we stopped questioning it. Then the humans disappeared. […]</description>

      <title>Why We Need More Programmers, Not Fewer</title>
      <link>https://juanreyero.com/article/ai/we-need-more-programmers</link>
      <description>TL/DR The conventional wisdom is that AI will reduce the demand for programmers. I manage engineering teams and program with LLMs every day, and I am seeing something different.
Programmers who know how to work with LLMs can be 3-10x faster for specific tasks. Given that the size of our work backlog is only limited by our vision and ambition, these super-productive individuals will be more in demand, not less.</description>

      <title>Lessons learned from 2 years of operating a teensy-tiny news archive</title>
      <link>https://til.andrew-quinn.me/posts/lessons-learned-from-2-years-of-operating-a-tiny-news-archive/</link>
      <description>I began running
Andrew’s Selkouutiset Archive
almost exactly two years ago, with a simple goal:
Create a straightforward way for Finnish language learners
to access the simple news broadcast by YYYY-MM-DD.
It has basically accomplished that goal, with only a few tweaks here
and there to keep everything running.
Earlier in the series: Lessons learned from 6 months of operating a teensy-tiny news archive.
I stand by those points, and have some more to add here at the 24-month
mark.</description>
