      <title>Computer Science Degree in 2026</title>
      <link>https://chrisdail.com/posts/choose-computer-science/</link>
      <description>Is it wise to start a Computer Science degree in 2026? Is AI going to take all of the software development jobs? These are especially relevant questions for me as my son graduates from high school this year. This is the advice I gave him.
I believe it is a fine choice to take Computer Science in the year 2026, provided the following two things are true:
You love it - The days of this degree guaranteeing a good-paying job are over. If you are just in it for the money, take up a trade which pays well and is in high demand. Competition for jobs, especially at the entry level, will remain high, so this is only a place for people who love it. You have the mind for it - If you don’t have strong critical thinking and problem-solving skills, you are better off looking elsewhere. The mediocre or below-average software developer will be the first to be displaced by AI. I graduated with my Computer Science degree at a funny time. The year was 2003, and we had just navigated through the dot-com bust. Similar to the market today, it was very challenging to find work. For the next few years, the common wisdom was “Don’t take Computer Science”. High School guidance counsellors were advising students to stay away. I remember visiting my University and was shocked to see how much the CS school had shrunk. Just a few years later, in 2008, I was having a terrible time trying to hire people. There were simply too few people with the skills required.</description>

      <title>how i found a europa.eu compromise (thanks to cricket)</title>
      <link>https://blog.himanshuanand.com/2025/11/how-i-found-a-europa.eu-compromise-thanks-to-cricket/</link>
      <description>TLDR
While looking for a way to stream the India vs Pakistan cricket match on 14th September 2025, I stumbled across a suspicious search result on a europa.eu dev subdomain. It was being abused for blackhat SEO and redirecting users to scam streaming sites. I traced similar behavior across other high-profile domains, reported the issue to CERT-EU via email (after some Twitter help) and the problem was later confirmed as fixed on 6th November 2025.</description>

      <description>For people who know me, it might be surprising to hear how much I love people 🙂. Especially the folks on the teams I’ve managed over the years. They’re relentlessly talented, curious, funny, stubborn in all the right ways, and full of these rich inner worlds that have nothing to do with their job titles. They’re engineers, yeah - but they’re also cooks, musicians, parents, painters, marathon runners, woodworkers, travelers, and everything in between. I genuinely love hearing their stories.

      <title>On Idempotency Keys</title>
      <link>https://www.morling.dev/blog/on-idempotency-keys/</link>
      <description>
In distributed systems, there’s a common understanding that it is not possible to guarantee exactly-once delivery of messages.
What is possible though is exactly-once processing. By adding a unique idempotency key to each message, you can enable consumers to recognize and ignore duplicate messages, i.e. messages which they have received and successfully processed before.

      <link>https://nicolas.kruchten.com/content/2025/11/vibe-cading-a-data-physicalization/</link>
      <description>Ever since I bought a 3d printer, I’ve wanted to dip a toe into data physicalization. I’m not very good at point-and-click 3d modelling tools, and this is kind of a casual hobby rather than serious work so I used Claude Code, an AI programming assistant, to vibe code a parametric Python program to generate the printable files. It was a real rush to find out I can just start verbally describing the object I want to an AI agent and then be holding it in my hand less than three hours later! So here’s the story of how I vibe CADed my very own 1960s-inspired Bertin reorderable matrix.</description>
