      <title>Liquid Glass? That's what your M4 CPU is for</title>
      <link>https://idiallo.com/byte-size/apple-liquid-glass?src=feed</link>
      <description>So, Apple just dropped its new "Liquid Glass" design language, and yeah, it looks slick. Translucent, fluid, subtly animated. The kind of thing that makes you nod and say, "Yep, that’s Apple." But while everyone’s drooling over the aesthetics, I’m sitting here having a serious Vista flashback. How many CPU cycles is this beauty actually costing us?</description>

      <description>Let's be honest, the financial landscape feels… weird lately. For years, the mantra for most investors has been clear: diversify, buy stable index funds, and let time work its magic. It wasn't the most thrilling advice, but it was generally sound. The idea was that the underlying fundamentals of the economy and the companies within it would eventually drive long-term returns.</description>

      <title>Douglas Adams on the English–American cultural divide over “heroes”</title>
      <link>https://shreevatsa.net/post/douglas-adams-cultural-divide/</link>
      <description>In 2000, Douglas Adams made an interesting observation that I keep returning to.
A user on Slashdot named “FascDot Killed My Pr” had asked the following question (where HGttG = Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy):
Comedy….or Tragedy?
First, a big thank-you. You’ve made a lasting contribution to “our” culture (or should that be “culture”?)
I first read HGttG in my early teens. I doubled over laughing the whole time. I read and reread the entire series, bought both Dirk Gently books AND Last Chance to See. Loved them all and wouldn’t trade having read them for anything. (btw, the first mental ward scene in Long Dark Teatime is a no-foolin’, all-time classic.)</description>

      <description>Warhammer 40000: Space Marine 2 is based on Swarm Engine, a proprietary in-house engine from Saber being developed for decades. This engine has already proven itself in tasks of simulating and rendering a large number of distinct and interactive entities. The sequel to the Space Marine franchise aims to depict a war of galactic proportions. It introduces new challenges for developers. This talk provides details of how we addressed some of these challenges. It shows what decisions were made and why, what were the limitations, and what lessons were learned.</description>

      <title>Internet voting is insecure and should not be used in public elections - CITP Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2026/01/16/internet-voting-is-insecure-and-should-not-be-used-in-public-elections/</link>
      <description>All internet voting systems are insecure. The insecurity is worse than a well-run conventional paper ballot system, because a very small number of people may have the power to change any (or all) votes that go through the system, without detection.</description>

      <title>Stanford scientists found a way to regrow cartilage and stop arthritis</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120000333.htm</link>
      <description>Scientists at Stanford Medicine have discovered a treatment that can reverse cartilage loss in aging joints and even prevent arthritis after knee injuries. By blocking a protein linked to aging, the therapy restored healthy, shock-absorbing cartilage in old mice and injured joints, dramatically improving movement and joint function. Human cartilage samples from knee replacement surgeries also began regenerating when exposed to the treatment.</description>
