      <link>https://amelieheinrich.com/post.html?id=rhi</link>
      <description>As games become more and more complex and the unified graphics API problem remains unsolved, one of the main problematics when making games and engines is how you handle multi-platform graphics API code. Over the years, we have seen a few APIs enter the scene trying to rule them all, but it seems like in the year 2025, this problem is still present.
Before we had the modern graphics APIs of today, we had OpenGL - a unified API, a global state, it worked everywhere and was very easy to use. However, as the years passed, and as the hardware evolved, more graphics APIs came into play. We had Direct3D, whose 11th iteration is still popular to this day in some engines, and almost 10 years ago, the arrival of Vulkan, D3D12 and Metal. Slowly but surely, OpenGL also started to fade away in the professional game engine space as it had too much driver overhead and was messier to use than newer APIs, that also exposed more features (raytracing especially).</description>

      <title>Software Architecture Horror Story</title>
      <link>https://blog.mihaisafta.com/posts/architecture-horror-story-1/</link>
      <description>This is a tale of software architecture decision-making in large companies.
The setup As part of my job as a software architect, I had to design a solution which involved the integration between 2 systems: let’s call them A and B. They were part of a new instant payment processing flow that was beeing developed. System B had a legacy integration mechanism that was no longer supported at the architectural level.</description>

      <title>The wild vibe | jarv.org</title>
      <link>https://jarv.org/posts/wild-vibe/</link>
      <description>It’s wild that these days you can vibe code an entire app in the same time it would previously take to contribute a single feature. Take the RSS reader I use regularly, Newsboat. It always had a few stability issues and was only about 80% there as far as the features I wanted in a terminal-based reader. There were other alternatives that came along, but nothing matched what I was used to layout-wise.</description>

      <link>https://liamrosen.com/2025/10/10/no-sysco-is-not-ruining-restaurants/</link>
      <description>There’s a meme going around that Sysco is “ruining restaurants”, and it’s spreading fast, probably because it feeds way too easily into recurring consumer fears concerning food quality, corporations, and homogenization. The problem is that the meme, like most punchy viral outrage, collapses under basic scrutiny. While there has been some underground Sysco-critical buzz for […]</description>

      <title>GNU Health | Freedom and Equity in Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://www.gnuhealth.org/about-us.html</link>
      <description>GNU Health as a social movement: GNU Health is a social project with technology behind. It’s about Social Medicine and delivering universal healthcare. It’s about social activism. One of the main reasons that led me to create GNU Health were the tremendous inequalities in access to healthcare. Over 20000 children die every day from preventable, social diseases. To name a few : malnutrition, contaminated water, child slavery, prostitution, war, malaria, HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, dengue and other neglected tropical diseases. These are causes and/or results of social diseases, conditions that have a higher impact and higher prevalence on the poor and the underprivileged.</description>
