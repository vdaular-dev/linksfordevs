      <title>So, You’ve Hit an Age Gate. What Now?</title>
      <link>https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2026/01/so-youve-hit-age-gate-what-now</link>
      <description>EFF is against age gating and age verification mandates, and we hope we’ll win in getting existing ones overturned and new ones prevented. But mandates are already in effect, and every day many people are asked to verify their age across the web, despite prominent cases of sensitive data getting leaked in the process.</description>

      <title>I Hate Github Actions with Passion</title>
      <link>https://xlii.space/eng/i-hate-github-actions-with-passion/</link>
      <description>I can’t overstate how much I hate GitHub Actions. I don’t even remember hating any other piece of technology I used. Sure, I still make fun of PHP that I remember from times of PHP41, but even then I didn’t hate it. Merely I found it subpar technology to other emerging at the time (like Ruby on Rails or Django). And yet I hate GitHub Actions.
With Passion2.





    
  


Road to Hell
Day before writing these words I was implementing build.rs for my tmplr project. To save you a click - it is a file/project scaffold tool with human readable (and craftable) template files. I (personally) use it very often, given how easy it is to craft new templates, by hand or with aid of the tool, so check it out if you need a similar tool.</description>

      <title>LLMs are a 400-year-long confidence trick</title>
      <link>https://tomrenner.com/posts/400-year-confidence-trick/</link>
      <description>In 1623 the German Wilhelm Schickard produced the first known designs for a mechanical calculator. Twenty years later Blaise Pascal produced a machine of an improved design, aiming to help with the large amount of tedious arithmetic required in his role as a tax collector.
The interest in mechanical calculation showed no sign of reducing in the subsequent centuries, as generations of people worldwide followed in Pascal and Wilhelm’s footsteps, subscribing to their view that offloading mental energy to a machine would be a relief.</description>

      <title>We can’t have nice things… because of AI scrapers – MetaBrainz Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.metabrainz.org/2025/12/11/we-cant-have-nice-things-because-of-ai-scrapers/</link>
      <description>In the past few months the MetaBrainz team has been fighting a battle against unscrupulous AI companies ignoring common courtesies (such as robots.txt) and scraping the Internet in order to build up their AI models. Rather than downloading our dataset in one complete download, they insist on loading all of MusicBrainz one page at a time. This of course would take hundreds of years to complete and is utterly pointless. In doing so, they are overloading our servers and preventing legitimate users from accessing our site.</description>
