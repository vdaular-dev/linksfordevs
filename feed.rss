      <title>The Return of the Viva</title>
      <link>https://ednutting.com/2025/11/25/return-of-the-viva.html</link>
      <description>Back in 2018, I was a teaching assistant at the University of Bristol (UK) on the 1st-year Introduction to Computer Architecture course. Aside from coursework and exams, the final grade included a viva assessment. Three or four students would be assessed by one or two lecturers in a viva: an oral examination similar to a kind of interview. In the age of AI, will we return to this style of examination?

      <title>How do we keep apps maintained on Flathub? (or building a more respectful App Store)</title>
      <link>https://tim.siosm.fr/blog/2025/11/24/building-better-app-store-flathub/</link>
      <description>There have been a few discussions about what Flathub should do to push developers to maintain their apps on the latest versions of the published runtimes. But most of those lack important details around how this would actually happen. I will not discuss in this post the technical means that are already in place to help developers keep their dependencies up to date. See the Flathub Safety: A Layered Approach from Source to User blog post instead.  The main thing to have in mind is that Flathub is not a commercial entity like other app stores. Right now, developers that put their apps on Flathub are (in the vast majority) not paid to do so and most apps are under an open source license.  So any discussion that starts with “developers should update to the latest runtime or have their apps removed” directly contradicts the social contract here (which is also in the terms of most open source licenses): You get something for free so don’t go around making demands unless you want to look like a jerk. We are not going to persuade overworked and generally volunteer developers to update their apps by putting pressure on them to do more work. It’s counter productive.  With that out of the way, how do we gently push developers to keep their apps up to date and using the latest runtime? Well, we can pay them. Flathub wants to setup a way to offer payments for applications but unfortunately it’s not ready yet. So in the meantime, the best option is to donate to the projects or developers working on those applications.  And make it very easy for users to do so.  Now we are in luck, this is exactly what some folks have been working on recently. Bazaar is a Flathub first app store that makes it really easy to donate to the apps that you have installed.  But we also need to make sure that the developers actually have something set up to get donations.  And this is were the flatpak-tracker project comes in. This project looks for the donation links in a collection of Flatpaks and checks if there is one and if the website is still up. If it’s not, it opens issues in the repo for tracking and fixing. It also checks if those apps are using the latest runtimes and open issues for that as well (FreeDesktop, GNOME, KDE).  If you want to help, you can take a look at this repo for apps that you use and see if things needs to be fixed. Then engage and suggest fixes upstream. Some of this work does not require complex technical skills so it’s a really good way to start contributing. This is probably one of the most direct way to enable developers to receive money from their users, via donations.  Updating the runtime used by an app usually requires more work and more testing, but it’s a great way to get started and to contribute to your favorite apps. And this is not just about Flathub: updating a Qt5 app to run with Qt6, or a GNOME 48 app to 49, will help everyone using the app.  We want to build an App Store that is respectful of the time developers put into developing, submitting, publishing, testing and maintaining their apps.  We don’t want to replicate the predatory model of other app stores.  Will some apps be out of date sometimes? Probably, but I would rather have a sustainable community than an exploiting one.</description>

      <title>Use 20x less peak RAM with dp_knapsack_sliding_hirschberg, a new activation memory budget solver for PyTorch</title>
      <link>https://jedrzej.maczan.pl/2025_11_21_dp_knapsack_sliding_hirschberg</link>
      <description>TL;DR: If you use a default
      torch._functorch.config.activation_memory_budget_solver=dp, you can change it to dp_knapsack_sliding_hirschberg
      and decrease your peak RAM usage during memory planning by a factor of 20.
      Currently it's only available when you compile from source (main branch), because it's not released yet</description>

      <title>What a CTO should know about tech | deadSimpleTech</title>
      <link>https://deadsimpletech.com/blog/cto_tech_capabilities</link>
      <description>Clausewitz (and I don't think Jomini particularly disagrees with him on this point) stresses understanding the capabilities of various units and weapons systems. What this means is that while you don't need to know how a cannon was made, how to ride a horse or the fine details of sabre drill, you need to understand what a cavalry squadron can and can't do like the back of your hand. You need to understand which of your divisions are hardened veterans and which are more likely to break when faced with undue strain. You need to know the range of your muskets and your field artillery, the capabilities of different kinds of shot and how your different arms need to be supported.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Determinism in Durable Execution — Jack Vanlightly</title>
      <link>https://jack-vanlightly.com/blog/2025/11/24/demystifying-determinism-in-durable-execution</link>
      <description>Determinism is a key concept to understand when writing code using durable execution frameworks such as Temporal, Restate, DBOS, and Resonate. If you read the docs you see that some parts of your code must be deterministic while other parts do not have to be.&amp;nbsp; This can be confusing to a dev</description>

      <description>I've been off work for about three months now. It's a
good occasion to take stock of how that's going. In a word, it's been great.



I'm surprised how much lighter my mood is. It feels like a weight </description>

      <title>I wrote an EF Core Provider</title>
      <link>https://anasismail.com/i-wrote-an-ef-core-provider/</link>
      <description>EF Core Database Provider for Azure Data Explorer (Kusto). GitHub     The project that I work on has a lot of data, in a lot of entities with a lot of fields, all exposed through an OData API. Naturally, that compels us to know exactly what kind of query shapes our users may be interested in and to create optimal indexes for them beforehand. However, there’s literally hundreds of fields and creating an index for every single one of them is simply not an option. Timeouts are great for protecting the database from maliciously demanding queries but they don’t offer much in the realm of user-experience. We need to allow clients to send arbitrary queries and we need them to be fast regardless of whether we’re expecting said query or not. It was clear to me that we needed a solution and not an optimization and so I considered exploring Big Data solutions and columnar databases. Since our infrastructure is primarily Azure-based, my boss suggested that we explore Azure Data Explorer (ADX) aka Kusto. In a couple of days, ingestion was complete and a little testing showed promising performance so we decided to explore our options for integration. Sadly, Kusto not only doesn’t have an EF Core provider package, the T-SQL support, although well-marketed, was poorly performing. It was very clear to us that this path would require a little investment. After discovering that EFCore.Snowflake, another library/database pair we considered using, is developed and maintained by one person alone, I felt motivated to take a crack at writing a database provider. I mean, how hard could it be in today’s AI powered era?</description>

      <description>When you enter a prompt into an LLM, the model converts your text into numbers, processes them, and returns a response one token at a time. In this article, we go through the journey of LLM inference and see how it works.</description>
