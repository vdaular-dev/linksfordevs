      <title>Environment variables are a legacy mess: Let's dive deep into them</title>
      <link>https://allvpv.org/haotic-journey-through-envvars/</link>
      <description>Programming languages have rapidly evolved in recent years. But in software development, the new often meets the old, and the scaffolding that OS gives for running new processes hasn’t changed much since Unix.
If you need to parametrize your application at runtime by passing a few ad-hoc variables (without special files or a custom solution involving IPC or networking), you’re doomed to a pretty awkward, outdated interface:</description>

      <title>2025-09-26 — Why I Choose Email Over Messaging</title>
      <link>https://www.spinellis.gr/blog/20250926/</link>
      <description>My colleagues and friends know that I prefer to communicate
with them via email rather than chat messaging.
There are many benefits in such a choice.
You may want to consider them and adopt the same stance.</description>

      <title>LLMs are getting better at character-level text manipulation</title>
      <link>https://blog.burkert.me/posts/llm_evolution_character_manipulation/</link>
      <description>Recently, I have been testing how well the newest generations of large language models (such as GPT-5 or Claude 4.5) handle natural language, specifically counting characters, manipulating characters in a sentences, or solving encoding and ciphers. Surprisingly, the newest models were able to solve these kinds of tasks, unlike previous generations of LLMs.
Character manipulation LLMs handle individual characters poorly. This is due to all text being encoded as tokens via the LLM tokenizer and its vocabulary. Individual tokens typically represent clusters of characters, sometimes even full words (especially in English and other common languages in the training dataset). This makes any considerations on a more granular level than tokens fairly difficult, although LLMs have been capable of certain simple tasks (such as spelling out individual characters in a word) for a while.</description>

      <title>Trying Out the Ptyxis Terminal Emulator</title>
      <link>https://leo3418.github.io/2025/08/14/trying-ptyxis.html</link>
      <description>In my years of using GNOME, I have been using GNOME Terminal, and it has served me well. There has been a newer GNOME Console; while it has a few nice new features, it lacks a small feature that GNOME Terminal has and I depend on, so I have stayed with GNOME Terminal. Now, a third terminal emulator option for GNOME, Ptyxis (TIK-sis), has appeared. I tried it out recently and quickly found myself liking it, though my declaration that it would be a good-enough replacement of GNOME Terminal for myself came only after I spent a few days tinkering with it. …</description>

      <description>There’s a dustup going on over at Bluesky over moderation decisions. I won’t go into details because—for the purposes of this blog post—I’m less focused on why the dustup is happening and more that it is happening. It’s happening at Bluesky, it happens on Mastodon, it happened on Tumblr, and it will keep happening in the future despite all the best intentions.
And I need to stop fooling myself that I want any part of it.</description>
