      <title>The Age of Ensloppification</title>
      <link>https://www.leemeichin.com/posts/the-age-of-ensloppification</link>
      <description>There’s been a mixture of hype and controversy about this new AI agent thing called Openclaw1. It bills itself as a Personal AI Assistant and, basically, you set it up with a bunch of integrations and let it loose on your life. To me it appears to be like Home Assistant but with AI agents.</description>

      <description>The cost of running a business is the maintenance of the original idea behind the actual start of the company. The value of the company is that continuous maintenance. The cost of starting the business is small, and the cost of having the idea is zero. If the idea was good enough, the business will go into maintenance mode up until it’s sold, merged or liquidated.</description>

      <description>Engineers are running 8 instances of Claude Code at once. That doesn't mean they are completing work 8x faster.

If you must hold the context for 8 agents in your head at once, your expertise as an engineer is wasted.
