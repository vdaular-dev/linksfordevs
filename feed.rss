      <title>Laptop Linux: A (perhaps too deep) Dive into a Kernel Oddity </title>
      <link>https://rohan.ga/blog/laptop_brightness/</link>
      <description>This blogpost is a synopsis of my personal journey chasing apparent oddities in the way my laptop’s brightness is set.
a new laptop A few months ago my (not so) old thinkpad was falling apart. The delete key was missing (which, does not lead to less mistakes, as I have learned), and the screen was affixed to the laptop lid by painters tape.
I am reluctant to switch laptops, as the setup and personalization cost is super high.</description>

      <description>After working in financial industry for a while you kind of become desensitised to lots of financial concepts or terminology. I realized it when I learned about a Luhn Algorithm or Luhn Check. This algorithm is a very basic checksum algorithm that works every time we input our credit or debit card numbers. In addition to that, it turns out that a wide variety of other businesses and industries utilize this simple check.</description>

As you know, Iran is like an open-source repository, because neither the people nor the government cares about the privacy and security of their own people.</description>

Sometimes you'll get the full nursery treatment: an "Oopsie-daisy" with a sad cartoon robot making a pouty face. The language has become so ubiquitous that it barely registers anymore -</description>

      <title>Your project should have .http files</title>
      <link>https://dev.karltryggvason.com/your-project-should-have-.http-files/</link>
      <description>It is a common ritual, grepping through http handlers or spelunking in a project’s Slack when you just want to know how to hit the auth endpoint. But it doesn’t have to be like this! If your service or app exposes or consumes an http api it should have .http file(s) that show how to make requests to it. Simple, executable, version controlled request documentation that improves developer experience.
In these files you write out http requests to the api endpoints using a familiar and easy to understand syntax (based on the RFC9110 - HTTP Semantics specification). Here is a very simple example:</description>

      <description>SwiftUI provides several tools for managing navigation, and the introduction of NavigationStack and value-destination links improved programmatic navigation. However, in larger applications, vanilla SwiftUI navigation can pose challenges for testability, maintainability, and modularity. Navigation logic is distributed across views, introducing coupling and making the navigation code hard to locate. These problems can be addressed by ... Read more</description>

Most AI writing tools have the order backwards.

They generate first, then ask you to fix it. You end up iterating on garbage, hoping something real ...</description>

      <description>A while back, I coded the CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) logo with a quick css-doodle implementation.
    There are certainly better ways to do it, but I chose to stack several black boxes and circles, because the background color was black, those black boxes ended up becoming</description>

      <title>Brief note on hand-drawing and Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://nigelvr.github.io/post-2.html</link>
      <description>A is a continous map from γ : [0, 1] → SO(3) ⋊ G
where G = ℝ3 or
possibly SO(2). In
other words, a drawing is a continuous path in a group like the one
above. Call the drawing group (the semidirect product) D. Then the complete drawing is the
composition [0, 1] → G → ℝ2. Let
P be the , i.e. the image in
ℝ2 under this map.</description>

      <title>Noel Welsh: Designing Custom UUIDs</title>
      <link>https://noelwelsh.com/posts/building-an-id-scheme/</link>
      <description>Of my recent projects, one of the most fun was creating an algorithm for generating unique identifiers.
In this post I'll walk through my process,
and show how a combination of mathematics, computer science, and business requirements lead to the solution.
I found this a very interesting problem,
and I think it makes a great case study of how theory and practice go together.</description>

      <title>Efficient Dockerfile templating for complex build scenarios</title>
      <link>https://gagor.pro/2025/01/efficient-dockerfile-templating-for-complex-build-scenarios/</link>
      <description>Why even consider templating Dockerfiles? Dockerfiles revolutionized the industry with their simplicity. Each instruction creates a new layer in the image, which is automatically cached. This process integrates well with SCM, where you “commit” the results of one stage and move forward with other changes. The process can be easily parameterized with ARG instructions, similar to ENV but provided during the build. This allows for creating highly flexible builds. For most users, this is more than sufficient. However, there’s a notable exception: Docker base images.</description>

This thinking is a bit of a companion thought to the delusion that within a limited system such as […]</description>
