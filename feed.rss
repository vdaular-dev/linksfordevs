      <title>On the Lies Depression Tells</title>
      <link>https://brianschrader.com/archive/on-the-lies-depression-tells/</link>
      <description>I'm no stranger to depressive episodes, though thankfully mine are sparse and usually brief: sometimes a day or two, though on rare occasions perhaps a week or more. I'm thankful mine have never progressed into anything serious. That said, I'd like to discuss something that's become somewhat of a theme in my conversations lately about depression, and something I hope you, the reader, might find useful when combatting this Great and Terrible Beast yourself.</description>

      <title>mostlyobvio.us — Responsive code formatting on web</title>
      <link>https://mostlyobvio.us/2026/02/responsive-code-formatting/</link>
      <description>Responsive Web Design was a hot topic over a decade ago. I'm old enough to remember Nicolas Barrera delivering a talk about it on wroclove.rb. It now feels strange not to design interfaces mobile-first, which is the primary screen for consuming content. And yet, when browsing code samples published online, more often than not we're left with with horizontal scrolls. Or worse, the hidden overflows.</description>

of adequacy, then finally (3) a period of workflow and life-altering

      <description>When you’re running a project in a tech company, understanding that your main job is to ship the project goes a surprisingly long way. So many engineers spend their time on peripheral questions (like the choice of technology X or Y) when core questions about shipping the product (for instance, how all the critical paths will actually work) are still unanswered1.</description>

      <title>OpenClaw is What Apple Intelligence Should Have Been</title>
      <link>https://www.jakequist.com/thoughts/openclaw-is-what-apple-intelligence-should-have-been</link>
      <description>Something strange is happening with Mac Minis. They’re selling out everywhere, and it’s not because people suddenly need more coffee table computers.
If you browse Reddit or HN, you’ll see the same pattern: people are buying Mac Minis specifically to run AI agents with computer use. They’re setting up headless machines whose sole job is to automate their workflows. OpenClaw—the open-source framework that lets you run Claude, GPT-5, or whatever model you want to actually control your computer—has become the killer app for Mac hardware. Not Final Cut. Not Logic. An AI agent that clicks buttons.</description>
