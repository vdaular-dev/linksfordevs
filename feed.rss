      <title>Qualcomm to Acquire Arduino—Accelerating Developers’ Access to its Leading Edge Computing and AI</title>
      <link>https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2025/10/qualcomm-to-acquire-arduino-accelerating-developers--access-to-i</link>
      <description>In addition to maintaining compatibility with the Arduino IDE and iconic UNO ecosystem, UNO Q is the first Arduino board to work with Arduino App Lab, a new, integrated development environment built to unify the Arduino development journey across Real-time OS, Linux, Python and AI flows to make development faster and easier. App Lab offers developers an open-source platform which is designed to rapidly ideate, prototype and scale AI-powered solutions to production. Seamless integration of App Lab with the Edge Impulse platform also helps streamline and accelerate the process of building, fine-tuning, and optimizing AI models using real-world data for a wide range of capabilities such as object/human detection, anomaly detection, image classification, ambient sound recognition, and keyword spotting.</description>

      <description>Beginners coming into our little corner of the programming world have it rough. Normal CPU-centric programming tends to start out with a “Hello World” sample, which can be completed in mere minutes. It takes far longer to simply download the toolchains and set them up. If you’re on a developer friendly OS, this can be completed in seconds as well.</description>

      <title>Automating and Managing Dnsmasq</title>
      <link>https://migus.org/adam/auto-dnsmasq/</link>
      <description>When I started my network and systems administration career in the late 90s,
I used static IP addresses far more than I ever configured or used DHCP relays or servers.
Remote recursive DNS, i.e., “DNS resolvers,” were common, but so were servers that did their own lookups.</description>

      <description>We get blamed for delivering these massive solution design documents that take weeks to produce, eat into the time for development and in the end result into an encyclopedia that nobody reads.And in all honesty, I agree.</description>

      <title>Primary keys using UUID v7 are (potentially) an HR violation</title>
      <link>https://mikenotthepope.com/primary-keys-using-uuid-v7-are-potentially-an-hr-violation/</link>
      <description>I'm building an applicant tracking system where I use UUID v7 for primary keys on the users table. Then I discovered an unintended consequence: UUID v7 embeds a timestamp, which creates a privacy leak. If a user's account was created in 2025 with an ID of 0199b901-fb2b-7745-9e62-019fe1c0ddca, anyone can extract that timestamp and infer a minimum age for the user. The older the account, the older we know the applicant must be, enabling unintentional age discrimination through what should be an opaque identifier.</description>
