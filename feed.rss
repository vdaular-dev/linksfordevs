      <title>Can Bundler Be as Fast as uv?</title>
      <link>https://tenderlovemaking.com/2025/12/29/can-bundler-be-as-fast-as-uv/</link>
      <description>At RailsWorld earlier this year, I got nerd sniped by someone. They asked “why can’t Bundler be as fast as uv?” Immediately my inner voice said “YA, WHY CAN’T IT BE AS FAST AS UV????”
My inner voice likes to shout at me, especially when someone asks a question so obvious I should have thought of it myself. Since then I’ve been thinking about and investigating this problem, going so far as to give a presentation at XO Ruby Portland about Bundler performance. I firmly believe the answer is “Bundler can be as fast as uv” (where “as fast” has a margin of error lol).</description>

      <title>TOMLDecoder Is Now Faster Than C (Thanks to AI)</title>

      <description>Recently,
I gave my TOML library written in Swift an 800% speed boost.
The natural question after that is:
how much faster can I push it?</description>

      <description>The first time I read about protocols was in the book "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho. This book goes deep. Deeper than I knew Python at that time. If you hadn't heard of Protocols before, I'll give you a short introduction.
