      <title>Thousands of CEOs just admitted AI had no impact on employment or productivity—and it has economists resurrecting a paradox from 40 years ago | Fortune</title>

      <description>In the 1980s, economist Robert Solow made an observation that reminded economists of today’s AI boom: “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.”

      <title>How to Get Lucky: Focus On The Fat Tails</title>
      <link>https://taylorpearson.me/luck/</link>
      <description>Almost everyone systematically under-allocates resources to the fat tails. We tend to spend most of our time and energy thinking about the middle, because we see the world through a bell curve lens, and most of the area in a bell curve is in the middle. But in reality, we live in an 80/20 world, where the top 1% of fat tails account for 50% of the results. The people who understand this seem to attract luck, but really they’ve just adopted the 80/20 curve model.</description>

      <link>https://nebezb.com/30gb-ram/</link>
      <description>My residential internet gateway is a two-in-one optical network terminal (ONT) and home router. The gateway is configurable only through a web interface my ISP controls and they, unsurprisingly, expose very few gears and knobs for me to play with. This must be intentional on their part. They probably get a lot less tech support calls from people locking themselves out. I’m slightly annoyed about waiting 15 minutes for the DHCP lease list to update, but not annoyed enough to do anything about it. $60/month gets me 2 gbps up/down. That’s a great deal even if it means I can’t customize much.</description>

In doing so, I figured out how we can keep our devices secure and isolated to our own private networks while still being able to operate them from anywhere in the world.</description>

      <title>The software engineer identity crisis</title>
      <link>https://adamfletcher.com/writing/software-engineer-identity-crisis/</link>
      <description>Software engineering has changed forever. We're far from reaching AI-assisted programming's final form, but it's already clear that the majority of code produced will no longer involve a human typing it out. For some people that's an uncontroversial and obvious statement. Others will dismiss it as overhyping AI's utility.  Irrespective of where you fall on the pro-AI vs anti-AI spectrum, the change can be deeply unsettling when, until now, your job has been to write the code that AI is now generating.</description>

      <title>Rise of the Triforce</title>
      <link>https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2026/02/16/rise-of-the-triforce/</link>
      <description>During the rapid technological advancements of the early 1990s, the video game industry was on the cusp of a massive addition - another dimension. With console shenanigans like the Super FX chip giving players a taste of 3D, hype was at an all-time high. But the games released for home consoles were nothing compared to what arcade developers were capable of doing. By employing gigantic budgets and cutting-edge hardware, the arcade gave players a chance to see the future, today.
But the future eventually arrived with the launch of the 5th generation of consoles. All of a sudden, the revolutionary 3D hardware features that were once exclusive to arcades were now available in home consoles. Without next-generation hype pushing players into the arcade, powerful but expensive arcade machines were no longer sustainable to develop. The industry adjusted by moving toward more cost effective solutions, with many turning to the inexpensive, already proven 3D-capable hardware available in 5th gen home consoles.
Rather than turning around the decline of the arcade, the cheaper hardware may have helped accelerate it. There were fewer unique experiences to pull players into the arcade, and previous hit exclusives were now seeing high quality home console ports that allowed them to be enjoyed without munching quarters. When the 6th generation arrived with the Dreamcast and the PlayStation 2, many arcade stalwarts waved the white flag and started to shift their arcade divisions to home console projects, with mixed success.
Sega was among those hit hardest by this era. They produced some of the greatest arcade thrills of the 1990s and enjoyed massive success in the home console market with the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. But a string of mistakes and miscalculations combined with the slumping arcade industry sent them to the brink of bankruptcy. By 2002, the Dreamcast had been soundly defeated by the launch of the PlayStation 2, and Sega began porting some of their hits to their former rivals' hardware just to stay afloat.
The home market was lost, but the languishing arcade scene presented Sega with an opportunity. They still had legendary arcade development teams, and if Sega could leverage them to produce a wave of arcade hits, they would be in a position to dominate a new era of arcades when most others were changing gears. There was just one problem: Sega didn't have the resources that they once did. If they were going to do this, they needed some help.
And so they did something that would have been considered unthinkable just five years prior. Sega teamed up with Nintendo to develop a GameCube-based arcade platform. Bolstering their ranks was Namco, another coin-op stalwart with tons of arcade veterans.
Three companies, one mission: Triforce.</description>
