      <title>Finding and Fixing Ghostty's Largest Memory Leak</title>
      <link>https://mitchellh.com/writing/ghostty-memory-leak-fix</link>
      <description>A few months ago, users started reporting that Ghostty was consuming absurd
amounts of memory, with one user reporting 37 GB after 10 days of uptime.
Today, I'm happy to say the fix has been found and merged.
This post is an overview of what caused the leak, a look at some of
Ghostty's internals, and some brief descriptions of how we tracked it down.1</description>

      <title>Common misunderstandings about large software companies – Vallified</title>
      <link>https://philipotoole.com/common-misunderstandings-about-large-software-companies/</link>
      <description>I sometimes read commentary about large software companies and notice a recurring pattern. People correctly identify real characteristics of large organizations, criticize them, but show little appreciation for why those characteristics exist in the first place. This is not an abstract topic for me. I have worked at very large firms - Nortel and Google,…</description>

      <title>I Tried to Find REAL Uses for Dell's GB10 — And It Passed</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=TLp1v2GsOHA</link>
      <description>An Edge Supercomputer... So I did what I always do: I tried to make one actually earn its keep.

On the bench today is Dell’s GB10 — a compact Grace-Blackwell system that claims petaflop-class AI performance without a datacenter, a cloud bill, or a breaker panel upgrade. Specs are easy. Real usefulness is harder.

      <link>https://edtw.in/high-agency-engineering/</link>
      <description>High Agency Engineering As artists adapt to generative AI, software engineering has to evolve too. This is the path I am adopting.
Plenty of engineers are struggling with their identity in this new age. Anxiety shows up even among the best of us, and anger isn’t far behind. I know both emotions. I pride myself on being a software craftsman, yet I am also the co-founder and CTO of an AI startup that keeps getting run over by paradigm shifts and better-funded startups (story for another day).</description>
