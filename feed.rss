      <title>Laptop Linux: A (perhaps too deep) Dive into a Kernel Oddity </title>
      <link>https://rohan.ga/blog/laptop_brightness/</link>
      <description>This blogpost is a synopsis of my personal journey chasing apparent oddities in the way my laptop’s brightness is set.
a new laptop A few months ago my (not so) old thinkpad was falling apart. The delete key was missing (which, does not lead to less mistakes, as I have learned), and the screen was affixed to the laptop lid by painters tape.
I am reluctant to switch laptops, as the setup and personalization cost is super high.</description>

      <description>After working in financial industry for a while you kind of become desensitised to lots of financial concepts or terminology. I realized it when I learned about a Luhn Algorithm or Luhn Check. This algorithm is a very basic checksum algorithm that works every time we input our credit or debit card numbers. In addition to that, it turns out that a wide variety of other businesses and industries utilize this simple check.</description>

      <description>Recently, I reverse engineered a dating app called Sheytoon1 and announced this on cyberplace dot com and X dot com. This app is mostly focused on dating between Iranian people. As you know, Iran is like an open-source repository, because neither the people nor the government cares about the privacy and security of their own people.</description>

      <description>When apps fail, when software breaks, you'll likely encounter a message constructed from a specific vocabulary: "Oops!" "Uh oh!" "Whoops!"

Sometimes you'll get the full nursery treatment: an "Oopsie-daisy" with a sad cartoon robot making a pouty face. The language has become so ubiquitous that it barely registers anymore -</description>

      <title>Your project should have .http files</title>
      <link>https://dev.karltryggvason.com/your-project-should-have-.http-files/</link>
      <description>It is a common ritual, grepping through http handlers or spelunking in a project’s Slack when you just want to know how to hit the auth endpoint. But it doesn’t have to be like this! If your service or app exposes or consumes an http api it should have .http file(s) that show how to make requests to it. Simple, executable, version controlled request documentation that improves developer experience.
In these files you write out http requests to the api endpoints using a familiar and easy to understand syntax (based on the RFC9110 - HTTP Semantics specification). Here is a very simple example:</description>
