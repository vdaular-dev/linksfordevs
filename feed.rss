      <description>Whenever we spoke to people thinking about cyber security roles, we kept hearing “SOC work is just staring at alerts all day.” So, to demonstrate that it’s way more than that, we built a learning pathway filled with practical labs to recreate the experience of being a Security Operations Center Analyst.</description>

      <title>You have to know how to drive the car</title>
      <link>https://www.seangoedecke.com/knowing-how-to-drive-the-car/</link>
      <description>There are lots of different ways to be a software engineer. You can grind out code for twelve hours a day to make the world a better place. You can focus on glue work: process-based work that makes everyone around you more successful. You can join the conversation with your product manager and designer colleagues to influence what gets built, not just how it gets built. You can climb the ladder to staff engineer and above, or you can take it easy and focus on your hobbies. But whichever of these you choose, you have to know how tech companies work.</description>

      <title>Pruning Claude Code conversation history</title>
      <link>https://brtkwr.com/posts/2026-01-22-pruning-claude-code-conversation-history/</link>
      <description>A few days ago I cleaned up 200GB from my Mac and deliberately kept my Claude Code history at 2.3GB. Four days later it had grown to 9.5GB. Here’s how I pruned it back to 1.1GB without breaking conversation continuity.
This also broke ccs - my fuzzy finder for Claude conversations. Parsing 3GB JSONL files was taking forever. I’ve since added --max-size filtering to ccs (defaults to 1GB), but that just hides the problem. Better to prune the files themselves.</description>

      <title>First, Make Me Care, by Gwern · Gwern.net</title>
      <link>https://gwern.net/blog/2026/make-me-care</link>
      <description>Writing advice: some nonfiction fails because it opens with background instead of a hook—readers leave before reaching the good material. Find the single anomaly or question that makes your topic interesting, lead with that, and let the background follow once you’ve earned attention.</description>

      <title>Bing is not as bad as you think (a search engine quality study) — nilch</title>
      <link>https://blog.nilch.org/blog/bing-is-not-as-bad-as-you-think-a-search-engine-quality-study/</link>
      <description>You've probably heard, or even said, how bad Bing's search results are in quality. It's true, they were pretty bad. Keyword "were". Back closer to the launch of Bing (then MSN search), the index size was significantly smaller than that of Google. However, here's the thing... it's been 21 years since it launched, and it has improved slowly over time a lot since then, and I have the data to prove it!</description>
