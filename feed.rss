      <title>Slopes in AABB collision systems</title>
      <link>https://andreyor.st/posts/2026-01-09-slopes-in-aabb-collision-systems/</link>
      <description>Recently (again, bored on a vacation), I started working on a game I’ve planned for a long time. I wasn’t satisfied with my existing implementations of a player controller1, so I started working on a new one. After a bit of fiddling around, I came to something I’m satisfied with, for now, at least, but while working on it, I wanted to add something I haven’t done in any of my projects yet - I decided to add slopes to my game.</description>

      <title>Local Email Debugging with Mailpit</title>
      <link>https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/mailpit-local-email-debugging/</link>
      <description>For the past decade, I've used Mailhog for local email debugging. Besides working on web applications that deal with email, I've long used email as the primary notification system for comments on the blog.
I built an Ansible role for Mailhog, and it was one of the main features of Drupal VM, a popular local development environment for Drupal I sunset 3 years ago.
Unfortunately, barring any future updates from the maintainers, it seems like Mailhog has not been maintained for four years now. It still works, but something as complex as an email debugging environment needs ongoing maintenance to stay relevant.</description>

      <title>Raising Kids After Knowledge Became a Commodity</title>
      <link>https://liorz.github.io/blog/posts/fallacy-education-for-academic-excellence/</link>
      <description>Growing up, I was relentlessly encouraged to excel. From my first steps into the “academic realm” - if one can even grace first grade with such a title—I was conditioned to equate my worth with my report card. Being a naturally curious child, I succeeded, though likely less due to innate brilliance and more because of a deep-seated thirst for achievement.
My parents were the children of immigrants who had been stripped of their own educational opportunities. One grandparent survived the horrors of Auschwitz; the others endured similarly harrowing circumstances during the war. In their homes, education wasn’t a luxury—it was an impossibility. Consequently, my parents grew up with little academic guidance, eventually finding themselves in blue-collar roles that left them feeling financially precarious.</description>

      <title>Statistics is hard</title>
      <link>https://misfra.me/2026/statistics-is-hard/</link>
      <description>I’ve been thinking about how statistics and probability are really non-intuitive. When you’re programming, if you’re wrong, it’s obvious. Your code won’t compile, or when you run it, the output is clearly broken. With statistics, you can be doing it completely wrong and have no idea.</description>

      <description>Once your app hits a certain scale—hundreds of millions or even billions of records—handling analytics and reporting becomes a completely different beast.

We felt this acutely last year at SparkLoop. Our platform had grown to store hundreds of millions of events just as we introduced an "Advanced Reports"</description>
