      <description>What is the right way to label something in HTML?

      <title>What Makes a Good Tool for Claude Code</title>
      <link>https://lalitm.com/writing-tools-for-claude-code/</link>
      <description>I’ve been using Claude Code extensively for personal projects, and similar AI coding tools at work. Recently I came across this excellent blog post that resonated with a lot of my experience.
One part stuck with me though: Noah emphasizes that tools fail with LLMs when they’re “overly complex,” with the Unix philosophy being particularly well-suited for tool calling. But then I thought about git.
Git breaks the Unix philosophy completely. It’s sprawling, stateful, and complex. And yet Claude Code handles it effortlessly. It composes commands that, even after 10+ years of daily git usage, I wouldn’t think to use. It handles rebasing, cherry-picking, complex resets—stuff that trips up experienced developers regularly.</description>

      <link>https://samueleamato.xyz/2025/07/30/the-future-of-authenticity</link>
      <description>A few days ago, I had been listening to a lofi playlist, one of those endless background mixes people use to study. In a few minutes, something felt off. Briefly, the track lost its point, the rhythm and the melody wandered in a way that felt forced, as though it was trying to follow a pattern but couldn’t commit to one.</description>

      <description>A Gaussian splat is essentially a bunch of blurry ellipsoids. Each one has a view-dependent color, using a process similar to training an AI model, you can optimize until it converges to the photos you feed in. The result is a sort of 3D photograph that can be viewed freely from any angle.</description>

      <description>As games become more and more complex and the unified graphics API problem remains unsolved, one of the main problematics when making games and engines is how you handle multi-platform graphics API code. Over the years, we have seen a few APIs enter the scene trying to rule them all, but it seems like in the year 2025, this problem is still present.
Before we had the modern graphics APIs of today, we had OpenGL - a unified API, a global state, it worked everywhere and was very easy to use. However, as the years passed, and as the hardware evolved, more graphics APIs came into play. We had Direct3D, whose 11th iteration is still popular to this day in some engines, and almost 10 years ago, the arrival of Vulkan, D3D12 and Metal. Slowly but surely, OpenGL also started to fade away in the professional game engine space as it had too much driver overhead and was messier to use than newer APIs, that also exposed more features (raytracing especially).</description>

The setup As part of my job as a software architect, I had to design a solution which involved the integration between 2 systems: let’s call them A and B. They were part of a new instant payment processing flow that was beeing developed. System B had a legacy integration mechanism that was no longer supported at the architectural level.</description>

      <description>It’s wild that these days you can vibe code an entire app in the same time it would previously take to contribute a single feature. Take the RSS reader I use regularly, Newsboat. It always had a few stability issues and was only about 80% there as far as the features I wanted in a terminal-based reader. There were other alternatives that came along, but nothing matched what I was used to layout-wise.</description>
