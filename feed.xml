      <title>Fast UDP I/O for Firefox in Rust</title>
      <link>https://max-inden.de/post/fast-udp-io-in-firefox/</link>
      <description>Motivation
Around 20% of Firefox’s HTTP traffic today uses HTTP/3, which runs over QUIC, which in turn runs over UDP.
This translates to substantial UDP I/O activity.
Firefox uses NSPR for most of its network I/O.
When it comes to UDP I/O, NSPR only offers a limited set of dated APIs, most relevant here PR_SendTo and PR_RecvFrom, wrappers around POSIX’s sendto and recvfrom.
The N in NSPR stands for Netscape, giving you a hint of its age.</description>

      <description>I recently purchased the textbook “Aircraft Control and Simulation” by Brian L. Stevens, Frank L. Lewis, and Eric N. Johnson1. This book covers the control and simulation of aircraft. It’s really dense and frankly hard to understand. As far as aerodynamics texts go, it’s pretty typical.</description>

      <description>So we're going to go down a little rabbit hole regarding groovy string interpolation which I found odd enough to want to write up. First, some basics. Groovy uses string interpolation syntax similar to bash, which looks like this: String foo = 'I am a fancy string' println("My string: ${foo}") Pretty straightforward, with a few</description>

      <title>My Homelab Setup</title>
      <link>https://dexteroot.net/posts/2025/07/my-homelab-setup/</link>
      <description>Intro I always wanted to have a homelab, where I can host applications and tinker with things. That dream has slowly materialized over the years, and I would like to showcase it here.
So currently, all my applications run on my Arch Linux machines. I am using Arch Linux mainly because I have spent considerable amount of time customising it. I learned Linux with Arch, and gained knowledge of systemd, the Linux filesystem, and manual package management via pacman. And as it has worked well for me all this time, I believe, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”</description>

      <title>Why The Double Dabble Algorithm Works</title>
      <link>https://yons.ch/posts/why-the-double-dabble-algorithm-works/</link>
      <description>When learning to program, students are often asked to implement a function that converts an integer to a string. Usually, what they come up with (and what they are expected to come up with) is to iteratively use division by 10 to get the digits of the number one by one. While this certainly works, division is considered an expensive operation, and so constrained systems (and perhaps standard implementations as well) use an algorithm called “Double Dabble” to get the decimal representation of a number.</description>
