      <title>Self Driving Biology — bits &amp; atoms</title>
      <link>https://mattshams.com/writings/self-driving-biology</link>
      <description>A pathfinding exploration of how biological experimentation is shifting from a human-driven craft to a programmable, machine-scale system, tracing the rise of self-driving laboratories at the intersection of AI, automation, and cloud infrastructure, and examining how this transition is reshaping discovery, economics, and governance across the life sciences, along with its tangible implications for longevity and healthspan extension.</description>

      <title>Anthropic, please stop suggesting to use Claude as a linter</title>
      <link>https://evgeniipendragon.com/posts/anthropic-please-stop-suggesting-to-use-claude-as-a-linter/</link>
      <description>I started using Claude Code recently. Working with it led me to read the manuals and best practices straight from the horse’s mouth - Anthropic’s docs themselves. As I was perusing the articles talking about different features and capabilities, and best ways to use it, I stumbled upon a section in Claude Code: Best practices for agentic coding, which states:
b. Use Claude as a linter Claude Code can provide subjective code reviews beyond what traditional linting tools detect, identifying issues like typos, stale comments, misleading function or variable names, and more.</description>

      <description>We spent the last decade marketing to 'Marketing Mary' and 'Developer Dave'. AI has made that obsolete. The future is hyper-personalization at a scale we couldn't previously imagine.</description>

      <title>A Professor in Every Pocket</title>
      <link>https://lagomor.ph/2026/01/a-professor-in-every-pocket/</link>
      <description>The scale of the cheating crisis in higher education is staggering. Depending on the survey, between 60% and 92% of college students now regularly use AI for their coursework. Professors are ill-equipped, and administrators are broadly turning a blind eye to the entire situation. Treating this as wholly the fault of AI is, however, a grave mistake.
The truth is that education has been broken for a long time, and AI was the accelerant that made the bonfire bright enough to see from a distance. In a system where degrees now primarily function as an expensive IQ screening mechanism, where learning is wholly secondary to certification, and where industrial-age teaching methods clash with information-age realities, AI has finally revealed the plastered-over fractures that have been growing for decades.</description>

      <title>The File System API is so underrated</title>
      <link>https://davide.im/posts/file-system-api/</link>
      <description>The File System API is so underrated, why isn’t anyone building stuff with it? There’s a whole bunch of small utility apps, the kind of freeware you’d normally download and install just to use once or twice, that could just live in your browser instead.
Claude and I threw together a couple examples this afternoon: a bulk file renamer and a swipe-to-delete photo curator (the usual Tinder like photo organizer). You can find both on smoltools, my collection of quick utilities I build for myself and throw online.</description>

      <description>The medal and the diploma are the physical symbols confirming that an individual or organisation has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
