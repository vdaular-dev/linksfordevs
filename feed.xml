      <link>https://www.mikeborozdin.com/post/how-mcp-and-chatgpt-apps-can-save-you-tokens</link>
      <description>That one weird trick... MCP receives input from an LLM, so you don't need to call it. Hence you save $$$.

      <title>Let’s Focus on Things You Can Control</title>
      <link>https://ramezanpour.net/post/2025/11/22/worry-about-things-you-can-change</link>
      <description>News websites — and certain people — can make you worry about everything. The moment you open a news site or talk to them, you start feeling anxious about things far outside your control. Whether it’s new workplace rules or world events, many of these sources of information are unhelpful, if not harmful.</description>

      <title>Tinkering with Generative UI</title>
      <link>https://pranavc28.github.io/blog/posts/generative-ui-tinker/</link>
      <description>“Form and function should be one, joined in a spiritual union” - Frank Lloyd Wright
Research code: https://github.com/pranavc28/generative-ui Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/cfahlgren1/react-code-instructions/ Purpose This blog explores how I fine-tuned Qwen, Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B, an open source model producing React code for a fraction of the cost of any of the top-tier AI research labs. I used Tinker to fine-tune my own LLM, a product released by the team at Thinking Machines Lab.
It did a great job, and produced generally usable React code at a better level that I expected it to from an online dataset.</description>

      <title>Indie, Alone, and Figuring It Out</title>
      <link>https://danijelavrzan.com/posts/2025/11/indie-dev/</link>
      <description>Going indie looks like freedom from the outside. But once you’re in it, you face loneliness, pressure, constant decisions, user feedback, and all the invisible work no one warns you about. This is what the journey feels like, and why it’s still worth it.</description>

      <title>How I Got Every Job Without an Interview</title>
      <link>https://manthanguptaa.in/posts/proof_of_work/</link>
      <description>I have never relied on traditional interview processes to get a job. No DSA rounds, no system design grilling, no multi-step loops. Almost every role I have landed came through a single conversation focused entirely on the projects I had built.
The reason is simple: proof of work makes interviews optional.
I didn’t come from a big-name college. There was no built-in reputation attached to where I studied, and no advantage from well known tags like IIT, GSOC, or Big Tech internships.</description>
