      <title>Dockerfile for a .NET 9 Web API Application | no dogma blog</title>
      <link>https://nodogmablog.bryanhogan.net/2025/09/dockerfile-for-a-net-9-web-api-application/</link>
      <description>I love using Docker to try out databases, caches, messaging systems, etc, usually accessing them from applications running on my host computer. Sometimes I want to run a .NET application in Docker, but I always have to root around for the Dockerfile!</description>

      <description>If this post is appearing, it means I’ve succumbed to cancer or one of its side effects. Please don’t feel sad for me. I’ve had a life filled with love, great experiences and wonderful career opportunities. Despite my demise at a relatively young age, I consider myself beyond fortunate. I’m hoping that, under the tree in front of our little Philadelphia rowhome, my wife Elaine will place a stone tablet inscribed with my name, and the year I was born and died.</description>

      <title>2025-09-26 — Why I Choose Email Over Messaging</title>

      <description>My colleagues and friends know that I prefer to communicate
with them via email rather than chat messaging.
There are many benefits in such a choice.
You may want to consider them and adopt the same stance.</description>

      <title>The Day the House Lost: Exploiting a Race Condition to Print Infinite Money (Rainbet)</title>
      <link>https://blog.z.org/the-day-the-house-lost/</link>
      <description>They say the house never loses, which, according to my recent trip to Vegas, seemed true. Security watches closely, slots are programmed to be addictive yet unfair. The whole place is designed to make a profit, and it does. That’s the house, but what if the house is online? That definitely changes things. The frontend interacts with the backend, and we may not be able to access the backend, but we can still tinker with what we can access. We can inspect the often obfuscated JavaScript and watch the HTTP requests being sent out. Those requests are what we leverage today to exploit the house and, yes, make money out of thin air.</description>

      <title>Time to separate the art from the artist</title>
      <link>https://christianheilmann.com/2025/09/28/time-to-separate-the-art-from-the-artist/</link>
      <description>A lot of the people whose work I adore and admire are terrible and weird human beings. That’s where it’s tricky to separate the art from the artist and consider if and how you want to support it. This gets even trickier when you find out more about the person, they get caught doing horrible things or their fame gets to their head and they start promoting a terrible opinion about something just because they can.</description>

      <link>https://archaeologist.dev/artifacts/priorities</link>
      <description>Story time. I used to live in a rented townhouse across the street from a
mansion. One night, its inhabitants hosted a flamboyant outdoor pool party /
rave with many guests, a professional DJ, and no regard for how their actions
might be impacting others. In the wee hours of the morning, our walls and
floors were still reverberating from the music, loud screams were heard, and
guests were seen climbing onto the roof of a car.</description>

      <title>When I say "alphabetical order", I mean "alphabetical order"</title>
      <link>https://sebastiano.tronto.net/blog/2025-09-28-alphabetic-order/</link>
      <description>Last month I have been on a multi-day hike with my dad. Each of us took
many pictures, and when we came back we put them all in a shared folder.
We both have Android phones, and the naming scheme used for our pictures
was the same: IMG_YYYYMMDD_HHmmss followed maybe by some other numbers
and then a .jpg. Here YYYY stands for the year, MM for month and
so on, so that sorting the pictures in alphabetical order is the same as
sorting them by date.</description>
