      <title>Why does a linear least squares fit appear to have a bias when applied to simple test data?</title>

      <description>I used python to generate a correlated data set for testing, and then plotted a basic linear least-squares fit. The result looked a bit strange to me, because the line doesn't really seem to pass &amp;...</description>

      <title>The Hive Mind · Jacques Mattheij</title>
      <link>https://jacquesmattheij.com/the-hive-mind/</link>
      <description>For the last couple of years, my colleagues and myself have been playing around with AI. I can’t speak for them but from the perspective of a casual user I am very much impressed by the capabilities on display. If you dedicate some time to it you can get a lot of mileage out of AI, it can help you in the way a highly interactive book would help, with vast amounts of knowledge at the tips of your fingers. As long as you are wary of the inevitable hallucinations and the AI’s tendency to get stuck in loops. Because the one thing that we have not yet managed to program in there is the ability to be humble: to realize that no matter how much knowledge you’ve got you don’t know everything. So “I don’t know” is not on the menu. It is not the kind of thing I have seen as output from the various AI offerings.</description>

      <title>Low-tech for kids manifesto - Michał Ćwiok</title>
      <link>https://cwiok.pl/index.php/en/2026/01/04/low-tech-for-kids-manifesto/</link>
      <description>Raising your kid without ever showing it a cartoon and limiting the screen time to zero is for sure possible, but carries a risk of it being an outcast. If we like it or not, kids will talk about shows, characters and recent trends and I feel that to some extent it is important to expose your kids to that. At the same time I want to make sure my kid avoids the never-ending recommendation feed that will keep it hooked. To get that I reached back to somewhat forgotten tech that still works and can be given to kids without any risk. Low-tech can give kids agency, without all the overhead of psyop doomscroll brainrot algorithm manipulation overhead.</description>

      <title>The Hardest Part of My Side Project Isn't the Code</title>
      <link>https://threekindwords.com/blog/the-hardest-part-of-my-side-project-isnt-the-code/</link>
      <description>When I kicked off this project at the beginning of the year, I set a goal for myself: send 300 kind words by the end of 2025. I’m happy to report that I hit that milestone on December 2nd. The 100th order was for the words “Dreams come true,” which kinda feels like a testament to what I’m trying to do here. Seeing that made me smile.</description>

      <title>Education after ChatGPT</title>
      <link>https://loukidelis.com/2026/01/04/education-and-ai.html</link>
      <description>A few times now, I have heard people bring up Socrates' suspicion of writing in the context of the impact of AI on learning. As a defense of AI, the point is that people (even wise people like Socrates) have long been concerned about the impact of technologies on the human mind, and in hindsight these concerns usually look silly. AI fears may be partly a moral panic. Still, AI is having an impact on learning in specific and undeniable ways. ChatGPT can write an essay better than many high school and university students, it seems, and many students are all too happy to outsource their essay writing–and critical thinking–to it. Teachers are struggling to prove that essays have been written by AI, and so the value of the whole rigmarole of essay writing and grading seems to be in question. Socrates thought that dialogue was superior to reading and writing for the development of the mind. In 2026, when everything is being thrown into question, this old idea might have fresh salience. In the same way that calculators made mental math (somewhat) obsolete, maybe LLMs, essentially information regurgitation machines, have made this standard part of education obsolete also. Should classrooms return to the Socratic method of education? I have to admit I love to imagine it, and I probably would have liked for my own education to have included more open-ended dialogue and less information regurgitation. I can’t say exactly how this would work and scale. One benefit of written essays is that they can be graded en masse. Maybe traditional grading systems will also have to be reworked in response to the AI disruption. What I do believe strongly is that nothing should be off the table.</description>

      <title>Snakes &amp; ladders: a short statistical analysis - Emir's blog</title>
      <link>https://emiruz.com/post/2026-01-04-snakes-and-ladders/</link>
      <description>Snakes &amp; ladders is a
classic board game, originally imported into the United Kingdom from India
circa 1890 according to Wikipedia. Its a square grid numbered row wise from
1-100, with some of the cells connected together either by a snake or a ladder.
Players roll a dice and then advance that many steps. If a player lands on the
head of a snake or the foot of a ladder they are transported to the respective
other end. The objective is to get to or (past) the last cell.</description>

      <title>Can I finally start using Wayland in 2026?</title>
      <link>https://michael.stapelberg.ch/posts/2026-01-04-wayland-sway-in-2026/</link>
      <description>Wayland is the successor to the X server (X11, Xorg) to implement the graphics stack on Linux. The Wayland project was actually started in 2008, a year before I created the i3 tiling window manager for X11 in 2009 — but for the last 18 years (!), Wayland was never usable on my computers. I don’t want to be stuck on deprecated software, so I try to start using Wayland each year, and this articles outlines what keeps me from migrating to Wayland in 2026.
