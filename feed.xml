      <title>VassiLife</title>
      <link>https://vassi.life/projects/diffinetune</link>
      <description>In this small project, the goal is to learn a bit the world of finetuning/creating LoRA's with diffusion models. Indeed, I did a bit of pre-training, both for LLMs and diffusion models, but I have not experimented much with finetuning yet. The idea for this project is then to fine-tune a diffusion model to include my face in the generated images. Then, I can generate a bunch in different wacky situations/styles, and randomize then in the first page of the website, including the caption used to generate it. Of course, by now models are so big and smart that finetuning to do this is quite overkill: I could simply provide my picture to chatGPT, and ask it to incorporate it in some images, and it would probably work better. Still, its a good learning opportunity, which is as usual the main goal of my projects.</description>

      <title>Noteflakes - My Thoughts on Euruko</title>
      <link>https://noteflakes.com/articles/2025-09-23-euruko</link>
      <description>I’ve just got back home from Euruko last night. The conference ended on Friday,
but I decided to stay two more nights in Portugal and visit Porto. In between
walking all over the city, eating great food and enjoying the dancing and music
making in the street, I’ve also had time to think about all the wonderful people
I met at the conference (and even some I’ve met and talked to by chance on the
streets of Viana do Castelo and Porto), and the incredible experiences I’ve had
at Euruko.</description>

      <link>https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115259943398316677</link>
      <description>Some loosely organized thoughts on the current Zeitgeist.  They were inspired by the response to my recent meta-project mentioned in my previous post https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115254145226514817, where within 24 hours I became aware of a large number of ongoing small-scale collaborative math projects with their own modest but active community (now listed at https://mathoverflow.net/questions/500720/list-of-crowdsourced-math-projects-actively-seeking-participants ); but they are from the perspective of a human rather than a mathematician.

As a crude first approximation, one can think of human society as the interaction between entities at four different scales:

1. Individual humans

2. Small organized groups of humans (e.g., close or extended family; friends; local social or religious organizations; informal sports clubs; small businesses and non-profits; ad hoc collaborations on small projects; small online communities)

3. Large organized groups of humans (e.g., large companies; governments; global institutions; professional sports clubs; large political parties or movements; large social media sites)

4. Large complex systems (e.g., the global economy; the environment; the geopolitical climate; popular culture and "viral" topics; the collective state of science and technology).

GBA audio has a reputation for being very low-quality, one that I personally think is deserved, but this is not entirely caused by the audio hardware.</description>
