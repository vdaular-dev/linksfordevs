      <title>REAC: 2025 Conference.</title>
      <link>https://enginearchitecture.org/2025.htm</link>
      <description>Warhammer 40000: Space Marine 2 is based on Swarm Engine, a proprietary in-house engine from Saber being developed for decades. This engine has already proven itself in tasks of simulating and rendering a large number of distinct and interactive entities. The sequel to the Space Marine franchise aims to depict a war of galactic proportions. It introduces new challenges for developers. This talk provides details of how we addressed some of these challenges. It shows what decisions were made and why, what were the limitations, and what lessons were learned.</description>

      <title>Internet voting is insecure and should not be used in public elections - CITP Blog</title>
      <link>https://blog.citp.princeton.edu/2026/01/16/internet-voting-is-insecure-and-should-not-be-used-in-public-elections/</link>
      <description>All internet voting systems are insecure. The insecurity is worse than a well-run conventional paper ballot system, because a very small number of people may have the power to change any (or all) votes that go through the system, without detection.</description>

      <title>Stanford scientists found a way to regrow cartilage and stop arthritis</title>
      <link>https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2026/01/260120000333.htm</link>
      <description>Scientists at Stanford Medicine have discovered a treatment that can reverse cartilage loss in aging joints and even prevent arthritis after knee injuries. By blocking a protein linked to aging, the therapy restored healthy, shock-absorbing cartilage in old mice and injured joints, dramatically improving movement and joint function. Human cartilage samples from knee replacement surgeries also began regenerating when exposed to the treatment.</description>

      <title>I finally got my sway layout to autostart just the way I like it</title>
      <link>https://hugues.betakappaphi.com/2026/01/19/sway-layout/</link>
      <description>I have been using sway as my default window manager on my laptop for a few years. One of the things that I’ve found most annoying about it, after over a decade of using KDE, was the lack of automated save and restore of running applications. There is a way to auto-start applications, but not to specify the way the resulting windows will be laid out.</description>

      <title>Your Prod Code Should Have Bugs</title>
      <link>https://lucaspauker.com/articles/your-prod-code-should-have-bugs/</link>
      <description>Debugging prod after shipping on Friday
Your job as a software engineer Every line of production code is a bet on speed, safety, and correctness. When you ship software, you are balancing:
Getting it done fast -&gt; shipping faster means the feature appears earlier for customers and ultimately the business makes more money Not introducing bugs -&gt; bugs can cause outages or other errors that lead to losses The problem is that anyone that has worked with software knows that no matter what, you cannot guarantee that your shipped software will not have bugs.</description>

      <title>Building a Multi-Tenant Metrics Pipeline for Thousands of Clients</title>
      <link>https://jamesrobb.ca/projects/metrics_pipeline/</link>
      <description>The last big project I worked on during my time at Yellowbrick was a brand new observability stack for the core product, an OLAP data warehouse. The company had finished a big push to create a cloud version of the product (which up to that point ran on a custom appliance) and we were finding that our mostly log-driven approach to observability was falling short. Diagnosing performance issues or failures took too much time and effort, and cloud customers had much different expectations on how to observe the health of their systems than our appliance customers.</description>
