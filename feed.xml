      <title>LLMs Are Bottlenecked by Linear Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://handmadeoasis.com/llms-are-bottlenecked-by-linear-interfaces/</link>
      <description>Current limitation as I see it So I have been experimenting quite a bit with LLMs recently (see my other posts, especially /state-of-ai-assisted-workflows-october-2025/) and dedicated some serious amount of effort to play around with the tech to both learn more but also to build an intuition for what it is and what it can do well etc. This has led me to having a realisation or an idea, that I’m sure is not unique but I have not seen much about it being mentioned yet.</description>

      <title>How I turned Zig into my favorite language to write network programs in</title>
      <link>https://lalinsky.com/2025/10/26/zio-async-io-for-zig.html</link>
      <description>I’ve been watching the Zig language for a while now, given that it was created for writing audio software (low-level, no allocations, real time). I never paid too much attention though, it seemed a little weird to me and I didn’t see the real need. Then I saw a post from Andrew Kelley (creator of the language) on Hacker News, about how he reimplemented my Chromaprint algorithm in Zig, and that got me really interested.</description>

      <title>Ossa: Towards the Next Generation Web</title>
      <link>https://jamesparker.me/blog/post/2025/08/04/ossa-towards-the-next-generation-web</link>
      <description>The internet is one of the most impactful technologies of today, enabling billions of people to communicate with family members around the globe, to share photos with one another, and to collaboratively edit documents in real time.
Most of these systems are built on cloud architectures where centralized servers store user information and synchronize that data across user devices.
The image below illustrates how this architecture typically works.
When a user makes an edit on their laptop, the update is sent to a trusted third party server which synchronizes the data and forwards it to another user's cell phone.</description>

      <title>Are transformers all we need?</title>
      <link>https://merqur.io/2025/10/26/Are-transformers-all-we-need/</link>
      <description>I vividly remember November 10th, 2017, the day I first read the “Attention is
All You Need” paper. I was in the Paris CDG airport. It struck me how similar
the architecture was to the autoencoders I had learned about just a few months
earlier at the DeepLearn 2017 in Bilbao. The attention mechanism (which I later
learned originated from Dzmitry Bahdanau’s 2014 work) seemed like a remarkably
elegant solution. It captivated me, sparking my deep dive into AI and shaping my
career in applying these models to real-world problems, but I never imagined it
would become the phenomenon it is today.</description>

      <title>Language Modeling with Hierarchical Reasoning Models: Lessons from 1M Parameters</title>
      <link>https://williamthurston.com/ml/language-models/transformers/2025/10/25/language-modeling-with-hierarchical-reasoning-models.html</link>
      <description>The Hierarchical Reasoning Models (HRM) paper made waves by demonstrating strong performance on ARC-AGI reasoning tasks with very few parameters, and the Tiny Recursive Models (TRM) paper pushed it further, setting higher benchmarks with just 7M parameters. The architecture uses hierarchical reasoning through recursion of transformer layers—effectively running the same parameters through multiple forward passes to reach impressive small model performance.</description>

      <title>That Time Ken Thompson Wrote a Backdoor into the C Compiler</title>
      <link>https://micahkepe.com/blog/thompson-trojan-horse/</link>
      <description>When Ken Thompson won the Turing Award jointly with Dennis Ritchie for their
work in UNIX, he was expected like other Turing winners to write a paper that
would be published in the ACM Computer Journal. What he ended up submitting was
a paper about "the cutest program [he] ever wrote"-- a sneaky undetectable
self-reproducing "Trojan horse" backdoor in the C compiler that would allow him
to log into affected machines as any user.</description>

      <description>A while back, I worked on a RISC-V-based userspace simulator for fun. In doing so, taught myself a lot more than I wanted to know about what happens in-between when the Kernel is asked to run a program, and when the first line of our program’s main function is actually executed. Here’s a summary of that rabbit hole.</description>

      <description>This post will age like sour milk, because Anthropic will eventually adopt the company-agnostic AGENTS.md standard.</description>

      <title>Writing Wednesdays: Tk Ths Job N Shove It</title>

      <description>When you and I worked on the assembly line at Ford Motor Company in Dearborn, Michigan, we had to worry about our production quotas, our standards of workmanship, and our supervisor’s evaluation of us. What we didn’t have to worry about was the structure of our day. That structure was defined for us and imposed upon us</description>

      <title>AlphaAgents: Multi-Agent A2A Implementation for Collaborative Financial Analysis</title>
      <link>https://c-daniele.github.io/en/posts/2025-08-31-alphaagents-a2a/</link>
      <description>1. Introduction The quantity of frameworks emerging for GenAI application development is incredible and, in my opinion, is becoming excessive. Every time a new framework appears, it seems to do more or less the same things as the previous one. Perhaps some have better modularization capabilities or more robust design against long-term obsolescence, but they all seem pretty much the same to me and, although I enjoy experimenting, the study of new miraculous and promising GenAI frameworks is becoming less and less appealing.</description>

      <title>The Essence of Prompt Engineering is the Art of Asking Questions</title>
      <link>https://ramsayleung.github.io/en/post/2025/the-essence-of-prompt-engineering-is-the-art-of-asking-questions/</link>
      <description>1 Introduction In today’s AI-driven world, “Prompt Engineer” has become a buzzword.
AI enthusiasts are eager to share prompts, study token control, and tweak temperature parameters.
The classic meme from Linux founder Linus Torvalds
Talk is cheap. Show me the code.
has evolved into:
Code is cheap. Show me the prompts.
Original tweet: https://x.com/tunguz/status/1856045530951917763?lang=en
But the core of effective AI interaction isn’t about technical jargon—it’s about how to ask questions effectively.</description>

      <title>Proof of Prompt</title>
      <link>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/proof-of-prompt/</link>
      <description>When I’m doing freelance software development projects and I’m asked how much time things will take, it’s always very hard to answer. It’s a very high dimensional problem, and you have many degrees of freedom: how much should you charge, should you do it per hour or not, if you use AI how should it be factored in the efforts and time you report, what is the separation between the stuff that you charge and the stuff for which you don’t charge, does asking questions to your client to better understand the problem, on Slack in the weekend, count as time or not? Facing these doubts, and if they forgo the route of charging by the hour (which can be logistically quite painful, and can lead to its own kind of bad outcomes) I guess that most people are quite happy to fudge a rough number for a flat rate, do a couple of rounds of negotiation, reach an agreement, and call it a day. They implicitly accept that the outcome of this process can go both ways: either you estimated too low, and this way you will lose something, or the contrary. And you hope that in the grand scheme of things, things should average out in a reasonable way: either your loss, or their loss, who cares in the end? But is is really working this way?</description>
