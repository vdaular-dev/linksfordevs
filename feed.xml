      <title>Qwen3-Coder-Next: Pushing Small Hybrid Models on Agentic Coding</title>
      <link>https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3-coder-next</link>
      <description>Tech Report GitHub Hugging Face ModelScope DISCORD Introduction We introduce Qwen3-Coder-Next, an open-weight language model designed specifically for coding agents and local development. Built on top of Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Base, which adopts a novel architecture with hybrid attention and MoE, Qwen3-Coder-Next has been agentically trained at scale on large-scale executable task synthesis, environment interaction, and reinforcement learning, obtaining strong coding and agentic capabilities with significantly lower inference costs.
Scaling Agentic Training Rather than relying solely on parameter scaling, Qwen3-Coder-Next focuses on scaling agentic training signals.</description>

      <link>https://forums.ankiweb.net/t/ankis-growing-up/68610</link>
      <description>Hi all,  Anki’s 19th birthday was about 4 months ago. It would have been a good time to pause and reflect on what Anki has become, and how it will grow in the future. But I ended up letting the moment come and go, as I didn’t feel like I had the free time. It’s a feeling that’s been regrettably common of late, and I’ve come to realise that something has to change.  For a number of years, I’ve reached out to some of the most prolific contributors and offered them payment in exchange for them cont...</description>

      <description>Being first has great costs. If you're in a jungle, you're the one macheting down the vines and shrubs. If you're a cyclist in a race, you're the one pushing the air forward, whilst the cyclists behind can relax in your draft. And if you're developing a novel product, you might make the wrong feature choice, and lose out to competitors that simply avoid your terrible, costly decision.</description>
