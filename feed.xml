      <description>There’s something happening on the Web at the moment that almost feels like watching that old arcade game Space Invaders play out across our servers. Bots and scrapers marching in formation, attacking our servers wave after wave, systematically requesting page after page, relentlessly filling their data stores while we watch our access logs fill up.</description>

      <title>M1 MacBook Pro as a k3s Node with Asahi Linux - Graham Stevens – Grh.am</title>
      <link>https://grh.am/2026/m1-macbook-pro-as-a-k3s-node-with-asahi-linux/</link>
      <description>Background At home, I run a small 4 node k3s cluster on Dell Wyse 5070, primarily for the experience but also just for the fun of it. It houses all sorts of containers, but happily handles almost everything I throw at it, including Home Assistant, an MQTT instance, Predbat, Smokeping etc. etc.
This little stack of 4 Dell thin clients sits on the corner of my desk, each being powered via a single USB power supply - this means it only takes up a single power socket under the desk for neatness. Each node is also connected to a single Ubiquiti 5 port POE switch (USW-Flex), which again means no plug sockets being used up under the desk (but of course requires a POE switch to power it elsewhere…). Lovely and neat! Each node has two 8GB sticks of RAM, and I’ve replaced the M.2 WiFi cards with M.2 to NVME adapters to all me to expand the local storage.

      <description>You add a DNS record. The app says it’s wrong. You check it, fix a typo, try again. Still wrong. You wait. You try again. Still wrong. You triple check it. It looks correct.
The app is checking DNS records in a half-assed way.
If you’re building a product that asks users to add DNS records, please take the time to verify DNS records properly.</description>

      <title>How I used Claude Code in a real data journalism project</title>
      <link>https://kschaul.com/post/2026/02/09/2026-02-09-ai-data-journalism/</link>
      <description>This morning three colleagues and I published a story outlining how the federal government is using AI. Here’s how I used Claude Code to help.
Agencies are required to publish a spreadsheet of AI use cases. Unfortunately (and unsurprisingly) each agency posts them in a different place on their website, in a different file format, using different column names and values. OMB will eventually consolidate these, but why wait when we can do it ourselves?</description>

      <title>Why Half Your Skills Expire Every Few Years</title>
      <link>https://arpitbhayani.me/blogs/half-life/</link>
      <description>That is the half-life of knowledge in computer science and software engineering - the time it takes for half of what you know to be replaced by better tools, approaches, or understanding. For an engineering degree earned in 1930, the half-life was roughly 35 years. By 1960, it had dropped to about a decade.</description>

      <description>What parts of my software should be tested? And how? And how do coding agents (e.g. Claude Code) change things? This is my attempt to succinctly explain how I think about these questions at the beginning of 2026 (software development is changing so quickly I feel compelled to note the date. This may all be obsolete soon).</description>

announcing the new Scheme implementation I was writing, scheme-rs.
Today I am excited to announce that scheme-rs has reached its first version,
0.1.0. You can check it out at it’s website (scheme-rs.org, which should be
updated to scheme.rs at some point when DNS propagation finishes) or its
github page.</description>
