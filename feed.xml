      <title>How to Get Lucky: Focus On The Fat Tails</title>
      <link>https://taylorpearson.me/luck/</link>
      <description>Almost everyone systematically under-allocates resources to the fat tails. We tend to spend most of our time and energy thinking about the middle, because we see the world through a bell curve lens, and most of the area in a bell curve is in the middle. But in reality, we live in an 80/20 world, where the top 1% of fat tails account for 50% of the results. The people who understand this seem to attract luck, but really they’ve just adopted the 80/20 curve model.</description>

      <title>This site runs on 30GB of RAM</title>
      <link>https://nebezb.com/30gb-ram/</link>
      <description>My residential internet gateway is a two-in-one optical network terminal (ONT) and home router. The gateway is configurable only through a web interface my ISP controls and they, unsurprisingly, expose very few gears and knobs for me to play with. This must be intentional on their part. They probably get a lot less tech support calls from people locking themselves out. I’m slightly annoyed about waiting 15 minutes for the DHCP lease list to update, but not annoyed enough to do anything about it. $60/month gets me 2 gbps up/down. That’s a great deal even if it means I can’t customize much.</description>

In doing so, I figured out how we can keep our devices secure and isolated to our own private networks while still being able to operate them from anywhere in the world.</description>

      <title>The software engineer identity crisis</title>
      <link>https://adamfletcher.com/writing/software-engineer-identity-crisis/</link>
      <description>Software engineering has changed forever. We're far from reaching AI-assisted programming's final form, but it's already clear that the majority of code produced will no longer involve a human typing it out. For some people that's an uncontroversial and obvious statement. Others will dismiss it as overhyping AI's utility.  Irrespective of where you fall on the pro-AI vs anti-AI spectrum, the change can be deeply unsettling when, until now, your job has been to write the code that AI is now generating.</description>
