      <description>After 25 years in banking tech, I watched a non-technical Agile coach spend two years redirecting every engineering problem into a process conversation. Here`s what happened, what it cost us, and what actually makes engineering teams effective.</description>

      <title>The first good Raspberry Pi Laptop</title>
      <link>https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/the-first-good-raspberry-pi-laptop/</link>
      <description>Ever since the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 was introduced, I wondered why nobody built a decent laptop chassis around it.
You could swap out a low spec CM5 for a higher spec, and get an instant computer upgrade. Or, assuming a CM6 comes out someday in the same form factor, the laptop chassis could get an entirely new life with that upgrade.</description>

      <link>https://codingismycraft.blog/index.php/2026/02/05/postman-from-api-client-to-everything-app/</link>
      <description>Postman just announced its March 2026 updates, and it’s a massive change and deviation from its original purpose as an API testing and documentation tool. In my opinion, the evolution of Postman, from a simple tool running locally to assist developers to build and test APIs into a complex cloud-based platform is a textbook example…</description>

      <link>https://brianschrader.com/archive/on-the-lies-depression-tells/</link>
      <description>I'm no stranger to depressive episodes, though thankfully mine are sparse and usually brief: sometimes a day or two, though on rare occasions perhaps a week or more. I'm thankful mine have never progressed into anything serious. That said, I'd like to discuss something that's become somewhat of a theme in my conversations lately about depression, and something I hope you, the reader, might find useful when combatting this Great and Terrible Beast yourself.</description>

      <link>https://mostlyobvio.us/2026/02/responsive-code-formatting/</link>
      <description>Responsive Web Design was a hot topic over a decade ago. I'm old enough to remember Nicolas Barrera delivering a talk about it on wroclove.rb. It now feels strange not to design interfaces mobile-first, which is the primary screen for consuming content. And yet, when browsing code samples published online, more often than not we're left with with horizontal scrolls. Or worse, the hidden overflows.</description>
