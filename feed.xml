      <title>A Very Early History of Algebraic Data Types</title>
      <link>https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/algdt-history/</link>
      <description>Been quiet around here! I’ve been putting almost all of my writing time into Logic for Programmers and my whole brain is book-shaped. Trust me, you do not want to read my 2000-word rant on Sphinx post-build LaTeX customization. But I spent the past week in a historical rabbit hole and had to share what I found.
It started with Algebraic [Data] Types are not Scary, Actually. The post covers AlgDTs1 in more detail, but a quick overview is:</description>

      <title>How I Organize the Papers I Read</title>
      <link>https://lambdaland.org/posts/2025-10-03_reading_papers/</link>
      <description>I got asked how I manage papers, notes, and citations for doing research. I started writing out a very long Slack message, but it quickly passed the threshold where I ought to just turn it into a blog post.
The short of it: I’m an incorrigible Emacs user, so I do a lot through my editor of choice on my laptop. That said, Zotero is a fabulous piece of technology, and I rely on it heavily to get my work done.</description>

      <title>Talent is Alignment</title>
      <link>https://xlii.space/thoughts/talent-is-alignment/</link>
      <description>Przemysław Alexander Kamiński · Raideur des doigts
September 20th, 2025 marks exactly one year since I bought Roland’s
FPX-30, 88-keys full sized digital piano. Being in my 4th decade of
life I never taught myself any instrument, even though I own and dabble with many.
In fact, while I’m unable to remember sounds or hear them in my head,
it seems I have a rather good understanding what “sounds nice” that
allows me to ad-hoc compose music.</description>

      <title>» A Looking Glass Half Empty, Part 1: Just Lookin’ for a Hit The Digital Antiquarian</title>
      <link>https://www.filfre.net/2025/10/a-looking-glass-half-empty-part-1-just-lookin-for-a-hit/</link>
      <description>There was some discussion about it: “Wow, gosh, it’d sure be nice if we were making more money and selling more copies so we could do crazy games of the type we want, as opposed to having to worry about how we’re going to sell more.” Hey, I’d love it if the public was more into what I like to do and a little less into slightly more straightforward things. But I totally get that they’re into straightforward things. I don’t have any divine right to have someone hand me millions of dollars to make a game of whatever I want to do. At some fundamental level, everyone has a wallet, and they vote with it.</description>

      <title>In Praise of RSS and Controlled Feeds of Information</title>
      <link>https://blog.burkert.me/posts/in_praise_of_syndication/</link>
      <description>The way we consume content on the internet is increasingly driven by walled-garden platforms and black-box feed algorithms. This shift is making our media diets miserable. Ironically, a solution to the problem predates algorithmic feeds, social media and other forms of informational junk food. It is called RSS (Really Simple Syndication) and it is beautiful.
What the hell is RSS? RSS is just a format that defines how websites can publish updates (articles, posts, episodes, and so on) in a standard feed that you can subscribe to using an RSS reader (or aggregator). Don’t worry if this sounds extremely uninteresting to you; there aren’t many people that get excited about format specifications; the beauty of RSS is in its simplicity. Any content management system or blog platform supports RSS out of the box, and often enables it by default. As a result, a large portion of the content on the internet is available to you in feeds that you can tap into. But this time, you’re in full control of what you’re receiving, and the feeds are purely reverse chronological bliss. Coincidentally, you might already be using RSS without even knowing, because the whole podcasting world runs on RSS.</description>
