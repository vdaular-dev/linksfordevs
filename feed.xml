      <title>Slopes in AABB collision systems</title>
      <link>https://andreyor.st/posts/2026-01-09-slopes-in-aabb-collision-systems/</link>
      <description>Recently (again, bored on a vacation), I started working on a game I’ve planned for a long time. I wasn’t satisfied with my existing implementations of a player controller1, so I started working on a new one. After a bit of fiddling around, I came to something I’m satisfied with, for now, at least, but while working on it, I wanted to add something I haven’t done in any of my projects yet - I decided to add slopes to my game.</description>

      <title>What should you write about on your blog?</title>
      <link>https://idiallo.com/blog/what-should-i-write-about?src=feed</link>
      <description>Whenever I hear someone express a thought really well, like they make a sharp observation, tell a funny story, or just have a moment of clarity, I ask the same question: "Why don't you have a blog?"

      <title>Local Email Debugging with Mailpit</title>
      <link>https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/mailpit-local-email-debugging/</link>
      <description>For the past decade, I've used Mailhog for local email debugging. Besides working on web applications that deal with email, I've long used email as the primary notification system for comments on the blog.
I built an Ansible role for Mailhog, and it was one of the main features of Drupal VM, a popular local development environment for Drupal I sunset 3 years ago.
Unfortunately, barring any future updates from the maintainers, it seems like Mailhog has not been maintained for four years now. It still works, but something as complex as an email debugging environment needs ongoing maintenance to stay relevant.</description>
