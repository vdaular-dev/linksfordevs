      <title>Why Authorization is more important than ever</title>
      <link>https://oscarevertsson.com/posts/why-authorization-is-more-important-than-ever/</link>
      <description>Broken access control is at the top of the list for OWASP top 10. In fact, it’s still #1 in the 2025 release candidate with 100% (previously 94%) of tested applications showing some form of broken access control. That number alone should make you pay attention to the concept. Add to this the fact that we are now in an era where pretty much every developer is using Large Language Models (LLM) to some extent and we are producing more code than ever as a result.</description>

      <link>https://linderud.dev/blog/self-hosting-dns-for-no-fun-but-a-little-profit/</link>
      <description>After Gandi was bought up and started taking extortion level prices for their domains I’ve been looking for an excuse to migrate registrar. Last week I decided to bite the bullet and move to Porkbun as I have another domain renewal coming up. However after setting up an account and paying for the transfer for 4 domains, I realized their DNS services are provided by Cloudflare!
I personally do not use Cloudflare, and stay far away from all of their products for various reasons.</description>

      <title>Price as Productive Capacity Signal</title>
      <link>https://danieltan.weblog.lol/2025/12/appendix-a-price-as-productive-capacity-signal</link>
      <description>Mainstream economics holds a foundational belief: prices signal quality, scarcity, and value. In perfectly competitive markets, prices aggregate dispersed information about supply and demand, guiding efficient resource allocation. When prices rise, they signal scarcity and attract supply. When they fall, they signal abundance and redirect resources elsewhere. This elegant theory underpins everything from central bank policy to antitrust law.</description>

      <description>I used to think that the world was as good as it could be. That things were this way because nothing better had been invented yet. I felt that progress and technology were a linear scale that all of humanity marched towards equally, stopping only at problems no one had solved.</description>

      <title>Metaphysical Boldness</title>
      <link>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/metaphysical-boldness/</link>
      <description>Some models of reality are bolder than others Digital physics is the body of mathematical and philosophical work treating the universe and the way it works as a giant digital computer. This is often associated with cellular automata, and names like Konrad Zuse, John Von Neumann, Stephen Wolfram, etc. What I find fascinating about this field is that the models it suggests are making very deep metaphysical claims: if they are true, it means that the underlying structure of the world is much different than we think, and radically simpler in a sense. Take the lattice gas automaton for instance. A version of it is an hexagonal cellular automata with very simple collision rules, not more complicated than the famous Rule 30 or 110, for 1D cellular automata. The impressive thing about it is that a simulation running this rule with many particles can be shown to approximate the Navier-Stokes equations, which are the classical complicated mathematics to describe the dynamics of fluids. Following Wolfram, I find it very appealing to consider the idea that the world is not somehow running “hidden mathematics”, somewhere and somehow, to solve some complicated equations in a seemingly magical way, but rather, that things are radically simpler, in that the world is simply implementing a set of trivially simple rules. The world is not concerned with, or made with mathematics, mathematics just emerges, with inherent and irreducible complexity, from extreme simplicity.</description>
