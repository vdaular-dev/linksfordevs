      <title>Currency control - Praful Mathur</title>
      <link>https://www.praf.me/currency-control</link>
      <description>I’ve recently been doing a bunch of research into international payments, stablecoins, and the role of the US dollar in the world today. What surprised me when reading the online discourse (the comments section) was how often people seemed to be talking past each other about technologies and systems, mainly because they had a different answer to the question: how much should the government control currency[1]?</description>

      <title>Analyzing the domains (and sites) of an authoritarian regime • Cory Dransfeldt</title>
      <link>https://www.coryd.dev/posts/2025/analyzing-the-domains-and-sites-of-an-authoritarian-regime</link>
      <description>If you've ever wondered what domains the US federal government has registered, there's a rather exhaustive list over in the [dotgov-data](https://github.com/cisagov/dotgov-data) repository on GitHub, which is maintained by [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov). [You can see the raw CSV here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cisagov/dotgov-data/main/current-federal.csv). They don't include the registration date, but you can derive that from public WHOIS records or by examining the repository's git histor</description>

      <title>I trained a ChatGPT clone for £75</title>
      <link>https://samdobson.uk/posts/training-a-chatgpt-clone-for-cheap/</link>
      <description>I just watched a machine learn to speak. Over the course of 4 hours, for £75 ($100), I trained my own conversational AI from scratch. Not by using an API or fine-tuning someone else’s model - I mean actually training a language model, watching it go from random noise to something that can hold a conversation.
It’s a strange experience. You’re essentially watching intelligence emerge from mathematics.
The setup I used nanochat as my foundation - Andrej Karpathy’s “minimal, hackable” implementation of the full LLM training pipeline. The beauty of nanochat is that it’s simple enough to understand but complete enough to actually work. No mysterious or bloated frameworks - just the core process laid bare.</description>

      <title>choosing friction</title>
      <link>https://phirephoenix.com/blog/2025-10-11/friction</link>
      <description>In 2018, legal scholar Tim Wu wrote in the New York Times that: Today’s cult of convenience fails to acknowledge that difficulty is a constitutive feature of human experience. Convenience is all destination and no journey. This piece well predates the current AI boom, but “all destination and no journey” is a pretty good explanation for why using AI to create art is mainly compelling to people who think about creativity in terms of producing content and generating intellectual property. They just want the thing they can market and sell for money or clout; they don’t care how they got there. I know you’re sick of talking about AI. I am too. This is only a little bit about AI, I promise. Like all my writing about technology, it’s mostly about people.</description>

      <description>Tomorrow, I am taking a very early morning flight to Chicago to attend DjangoCon US. Buttondown is sponsoring, less as an exercise in lead generation and more as an act of circuitous open source sponsorship, and perhaps "sponsorship" is not quite the right word compared to gratuity in the most literal sense. I have been writing Django for fourteen years now: I started during 1.3, a hinterlands time that I remember mostly in two respects:</description>

      <description>Programming languages have rapidly evolved in recent years. But in software development, the new often meets the old, and the scaffolding that OS gives for running new processes hasn’t changed much since Unix.
If you need to parametrize your application at runtime by passing a few ad-hoc variables (without special files or a custom solution involving IPC or networking), you’re doomed to a pretty awkward, outdated interface:</description>

      <title>LLMs are getting better at character-level text manipulation</title>
      <link>https://blog.burkert.me/posts/llm_evolution_character_manipulation/</link>
      <description>Recently, I have been testing how well the newest generations of large language models (such as GPT-5 or Claude 4.5) handle natural language, specifically counting characters, manipulating characters in a sentences, or solving encoding and ciphers. Surprisingly, the newest models were able to solve these kinds of tasks, unlike previous generations of LLMs.
Character manipulation LLMs handle individual characters poorly. This is due to all text being encoded as tokens via the LLM tokenizer and its vocabulary. Individual tokens typically represent clusters of characters, sometimes even full words (especially in English and other common languages in the training dataset). This makes any considerations on a more granular level than tokens fairly difficult, although LLMs have been capable of certain simple tasks (such as spelling out individual characters in a word) for a while.</description>

      <title>Trying Out the Ptyxis Terminal Emulator</title>
      <link>https://leo3418.github.io/2025/08/14/trying-ptyxis.html</link>
      <description>In my years of using GNOME, I have been using GNOME Terminal, and it has served me well. There has been a newer GNOME Console; while it has a few nice new features, it lacks a small feature that GNOME Terminal has and I depend on, so I have stayed with GNOME Terminal. Now, a third terminal emulator option for GNOME, Ptyxis (TIK-sis), has appeared. I tried it out recently and quickly found myself liking it, though my declaration that it would be a good-enough replacement of GNOME Terminal for myself came only after I spent a few days tinkering with it. …</description>
