      <description>If you're not caught up on the current hypewave, coding agents like Claude Code and Cursor have latched onto skills recently. Like with all of these waves, everyone has immediately proclaimed they solve all problems, and all previous iterations of technology are no longer relevant. That's obviously not true, and I want to talk about my thinking behind them.</description>

      <title>Why Offline Learning Still Matters in 2026</title>
      <link>https://takuti.me/note/offline-learning/</link>
      <description>Short answer: There are two extremes in our world—hyper-connected world of rich countries, and a disconnected world of underserved communities like rural Africa.
I've seen both, and I conclude that being in a low-resource and low-connectivity environment was neither a disadvantage nor a limitation if they could receive localized, tailored services.
Being online is a privilege First of all, not everyone enjoys the online environment. More than 25% of the global population still doesn't use the internet1, and the disconnected population can reach around 80% in low-income countries, like Malawi2.
That's why we need a different approach to achieve a similar goal. Education, for example, cannot rely on tablets, Zoom, or Google Docs in many parts of the world, yet we can still deliver a remote learning experience through low-tech applications like USSD.
Learning initiatives fail when we apply the rules of the hyper-connected world to the disconnected world without adapting to its context.
Hands-on needs are in the field Moreover, context adaptation is only possible based on an accurate, vivid understanding of the context, which requires extensive fieldwork and interviews. It is an in-person process of learning who, where, which, why, what, and how a certain problem emerges and evolves.</description>

      <title>Speculative Decoding Is Not a Heuristic – Reed Meyerson</title>
      <link>https://reedmeyerson.com/posts/speculative_decoding_not_heuristic/</link>
      <description>Speculative decoding is a technique which uses a fast draft model to accelerate the inference of a slow target model. With the right verification procedure, speculative decoding can be lossless (i.e. it reproduces the quality of the target model). For token-by-token verification procedures, the criteria for lossless decoding can be written as a system of linear equations and inequalities. The acceptance rate, which directly controls model throughput, is also linear in the same variables. Thus, the optimal verification procedure is obtained by solving a linear program. This linear program is equivalent to an optimal transport problem from the draft distribution to the target distribution.</description>

      <description>For all the rightful criticisms that C gets, GLib does manage to alleviate at least some of it. If we can’t use a better language, we should at least make use of all the tools we have in C with GLib.
This post looks at the topic of ownership, and also how it applies to libdex fibers.
Ownership In normal C usage, it is often not obvious at all if an object that gets returned from a function (either as a real return value or as an out-parameter) is owned by the caller or the callee:</description>
