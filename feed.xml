      <title>More accurate Doom colormap</title>
      <link>https://30fps.net/pages/doom-oklab/</link>
      <description>In 1993, Doom famously used a palette trick for its “light diminishing” effect.
Walls, floors, and sprites became progressively darker farther away from the camera.
It’s nothing special nowadays, but at the time, it must have appeared really atmospheric.</description>

      <description>What is the hardest problem in computer science? Phil Karlton famously quipped, “There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.” Martin Fowler has a number of variations of this quote on his blog. My favorite is, “There’s two hard problems in computer science: we only have one joke and it’s not funny.”</description>

      <link>https://abuseofnotation.github.io/boolean-thinking/</link>
      <description>In my last post about generality, I tried to show how our ambition to discover ideas that are all-encompassing and eternal makes our worldview crumble, leaving us unable to think clearly even about simple issues with obvious solutions. Today, I want to discuss another instance of the same problem, in a simpler and more direct way. You can think of this essay as a prequel to “When Universality Breaks.”</description>

      <link>https://blog.balthazar-rouberol.com/curating-and-filtering-rss-feeds</link>
      <description>RSS feeds are one of my favorite features of the Internet of Yore. Simply put, they allow you to subscribe to sites you like, into an aggregator. Instead of visiting all these sites in search for something new, you simply subscribe to these sites in your aggregator, and you'll see new articles come in. In this article, I present feedzgerald, a small CLI tool used to filter online RSS feeds in order to only subscribe to content you're truly interested in.</description>

      <title>An underqualified reading list about the transformer architecture</title>
      <link>https://fvictorio.github.io/posts/underqualified-transformer-reading-list/</link>
      <description>When I see a list of learning resources, I assume that whoever curated it knows much more about the topic than what I’ll learn. So you wouldn’t be blamed for thinking that I have read 100x the amount of things about the transformer architecture than what I’m sharing here. In reality, that multiplier is shamefully close to 1x. Put another way: I have no idea what I’m talking about.</description>
