      <description>Here are two bugs that I ran into while adding Sega CD support to my Genesis emulator, both related to emulating the Sega CD’s CD-ROM hardware. These are from a while ago but I think they’re still interesting enough to write about.</description>

      <title>Claude Sonnet plays HW synth (Roland T-8)</title>
      <link>https://vaclav.synacek.com/blog/2025/11/18/claude-sonnet-plays-hw-synth-roland-t8/</link>
      <description>I was discussing AI with several friends and what it does to
programming and the world. One of the themes was connecting AI to
physical stuff. On an unrelated path I bought some Roland synths to play
with and ended up not using them much, because there is too much other
stuff happening in the world. And then I had this idea to connect the
dots, connect the two hobbies, to find out if AI can be connected to HW
synths to play some music.</description>

      <title>Deep dive into the small details of micrograd</title>
      <link>https://omrishneor.github.io/2025/11/18/deep-dive-into-the-small-details-of-micrograd/</link>
      <description>Introduction In this first post in a series of posts where I will deep dive into the lectures of Andrej Karpathy’s “Neural Networks: Zero to Hero” course. I want to explore the small details that were skimmed through, left out or not explained in depth in the first lecture about micrograd. And hopefully add some intuition and motivation behind some concepts that were introduced in that lecture.</description>
