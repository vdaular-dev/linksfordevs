      <title>Qualcomm to Acquire Arduino—Accelerating Developers’ Access to its Leading Edge Computing and AI</title>
      <link>https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2025/10/qualcomm-to-acquire-arduino-accelerating-developers--access-to-i</link>
      <description>In addition to maintaining compatibility with the Arduino IDE and iconic UNO ecosystem, UNO Q is the first Arduino board to work with Arduino App Lab, a new, integrated development environment built to unify the Arduino development journey across Real-time OS, Linux, Python and AI flows to make development faster and easier. App Lab offers developers an open-source platform which is designed to rapidly ideate, prototype and scale AI-powered solutions to production. Seamless integration of App Lab with the Edge Impulse platform also helps streamline and accelerate the process of building, fine-tuning, and optimizing AI models using real-world data for a wide range of capabilities such as object/human detection, anomaly detection, image classification, ambient sound recognition, and keyword spotting.</description>

      <description>Beginners coming into our little corner of the programming world have it rough. Normal CPU-centric programming tends to start out with a “Hello World” sample, which can be completed in mere minutes. It takes far longer to simply download the toolchains and set them up. If you’re on a developer friendly OS, this can be completed in seconds as well.</description>
