      <title>Marble Fountain</title>
      <link>https://willmorrison.net/posts/marble-fountain/</link>
      <description>I really enjoy procedural generation, especially systems designed to work with hardware outputs. After starting work at Formlabs in September of 2023 and gaining access to much nicer printers than I was used to, I started wanting to tackle some large algorithmic structure projects. Complexity is free in 3d printing, the limit of design geometry is mostly how much time you’re willing to spend in CAD. I wanted to print the most complicated art piece I could think of.</description>

      <title>Does Wayland fractional scaling work with games in 2025?</title>
      <link>https://shuhaowu.com/blog/2025/01-fractional-scaling.html</link>
      <description>Author's note: my understanding of fractional scaling is based on some casual
reading and as an user. I'm thus missing a lot of detail and nuance. If you
find a factual error in this post, please email me and I'll correct it. Thank

      <title>Building an epaper laptop: The monitor</title>
      <link>https://peterme.net/building-an-epaper-laptop-the-monitor.html</link>
      <description>The most distinct part of making
an epaper laptop is obviously the screen. And picking a screen for this
project was always going to be one of the most critical decisions. The
biggest available panel I could find with a somewhat reasonable price
was a 10.3” Waveshare panel that also shipped as a separate HDMI screen.
Since the panel would always be a big expenditure having the comfort of
knowing I could always fall back to just using the HDMI driver board in
the monitor made it easier to swallow the cost. Even if I failed to
create a meaningful driver for the panel I would at least be able to go
ahead with the project.</description>

      <title>Why I stopped proofreading and started to listen</title>
      <link>https://refp.se/articles/I-stopped-proofreading-and-started-to-listen</link>
      <description>Proofreading is annoying and error-prone. Listening to your writing catches those mistakes which your brain and eyes are trying their very best to keep hidden.
