      <description>Mozilla is developing a built‑in AI assistant for Firefox that will be offered as a third browsing mode alongside Normal and Private tabs. They’re calling it “Window AI.” Details are still scarce.</description>

      <title>Why agents DO NOT write most of our code - a reality check</title>

      <description>At Octomind, we build AI agents - but our code is still mostly written by humans. We love LLMs and use them everywhere we can, from our product to our internal workflows. But despite all the hype, we’re nowhere near “agents writing most of our code.”</description>

      <title>Tracking Down Progressively-Enhanceable APIs</title>
      <link>https://willhbr.net/2025/11/07/tracking-down-progressively-enhanceable-apis/</link>
      <description>Something that I’m a big fan of is APIs that can be easily modified and hacked with. It’s frustrating to have to write fully production-ready code when you actually want to just prototype something, and so I’m happy when there’s an API that it’s easy to use, which then progresses into a more full-featured API. In Crystal an example of this is File.read. If you want to get the entire contents of a file you can just do: contents =...</description>

It forces builders to use old techniques despite advancing technology. If cars were over-regulated in the same way housing is, you would still have everyone driving Model T Fords!

      <title>Eggtastic Fortress</title>
      <link>https://ahmed1011001.github.io/Notes/stories/eggstrodinary.html</link>
      <description>It began, as many thought exercises do, with a discussion in the
          kitchen. My wife and I were debating whether a cooked egg was still
          safe to eat after spending the night on the kitchen counter. I am 
          certainly not the type to throw away food lightly at the lightest hint 
          of an issue. Confidently, I told her the egg would be fine. After all, 
          eggshells are made of calcium carbonate, solid, sealed, and, 
          in my mind, impenetrable to any contaminants.</description>
