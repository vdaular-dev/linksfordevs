      <title>OpenPBR: Novel Features and Implementation Details</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23696</link>
      <description>OpenPBR is a physically based, standardized uber-shader developed for interoperable material authoring and rendering across VFX, animation, and design visualization workflows. This document serves as a companion to the official specification, offering deeper insight into the model's development and more detailed implementation guidance, including code examples and mathematical derivations.
  We begin with a description of the model's formal structure and theoretical foundations - covering slab-based layering, statistical mixing, and microfacet theory - before turning to its physical components. These include metallic, dielectric, subsurface, and glossy-diffuse base substrates, followed by thin-film iridescence, coat, and fuzz layers. A special-case mode for rendering thin-walled objects is also described.
  Additional sections explore technical topics in greater depth, such as the decoupling of specular reflectivity from transmission, the choice of parameterization for subsurface scattering, and the detailed physics of coat darkening and thin-film interference. We also discuss planned extensions, including hazy specular reflection and retroreflection.</description>

      <title>Indirect Rendering // Vulkan For Beginners #27</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=f0aT0ifRo-k</link>
      <description>In this video we learn how to implement Indirect Rendering in Vulkan. This implementation is based on Descriptor Indexing from the previous video.

🔥 See the list of the books that I'm using as background information for my tutorials: https://ogldev.org/books.html. I highly recommend them for learning more about OpenGL and Vulkan. These are affiliate links so if you use them to buy any of the books the price is the same for you and I will get a small commission (thank-you!).

      <title>Surprise! A derivation of entropy</title>
      <link>https://iahmed.me/post/surprise-derivation-entropy/</link>
      <description>In this post, I will derive entropy from first principles. This requires no more than a high school-level understanding of mathematics. This derivation is based on Shannon’s original seminal paper, A mathematical theory of communication.
A derivation
The conditions
We want a function, $H(n)$, which measures the uncertainty in a system in which we chose one of $n$ events that can occur. We would want it to exhibit the following three properties:</description>

      <title>Improving the Flatpak Graphics Drivers Situation</title>
      <link>https://blog.sebastianwick.net/posts/flatpak-graphics-drivers/</link>
      <description>Graphics drivers in Flatpak have been a bit of a pain point. The drivers have to be built against the runtime to work in the runtime. This usually isn’t much of an issue but it breaks down in two cases:
If the driver depends on a specific kernel version If the runtime is end-of-life (EOL) The first issue is what the proprietary Nvidia drivers exhibit. A specific user space driver requires a specific kernel driver. For drivers in Mesa, this isn’t an issue. In the medium term, we might get lucky here and the Mesa-provided Nova driver might become competitive with the proprietary driver. Not all hardware will be supported though, and some people might need CUDA or other proprietary features, so this problem likely won’t go away completely.</description>
