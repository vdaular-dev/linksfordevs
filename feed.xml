      <description>Cloudflare just published a vibe coded blog post claiming they implemented Matrix on cloudflare workers. They didn't, their post and README is AI generated and the code doesn't do any of the core parts of matrix that make it secure and interoperable. Instead it's littered with 'TODO: Check authorisation' and similar

      <description>If the following image doesn’t make sense to you, there’s a good chance you haven’t fully grasped positional encodings in transformer architecture. Please stick around as I’ll try to explain them in a way that actually feels intuitive.
The 128-dimensional positional encoding for a sentence Context This blog is a part of my quest to properly understand the transformer architecture. Previously, I tried to explain self-attention in my own way here.</description>

      <title>Setting up Year in Command Line — Danish Prakash</title>
      <link>https://danishpraka.sh/posts/setting-up-year-in-command-line/</link>
      <description>I’ve tracked my command line history in a MariaDB instance for the past 5 years. The original idea was to simple keep track of everything I do on the command line so that I can refer to them later on. The utility of the history command was immediately apparent to me and so the logical next step was to store the history in a more sophisticated setup.</description>

      <description>There's this common argument that only those who are bad at coding, or don't care about the craft of it, use AI to code. I think this is pretty clearly false. Let's look at a list, shall we? More iffy ones:This refutes a few arguments that I see a lot of people make, especially in places like lobste. rs:The point isn't to say that you have to use AI, or that it has no downsides or risks, or no reasons to be skeptical, but more to say that at this point it's just not sane or feasible to claim tha...</description>

      <link>https://kywch.github.io/blog/2026/01/less-is-more-2048-agents/</link>
      <description>Last month, I wrote about how curriculum learning helped me train a 2048 agent that reaches the 65k tile. That agent achieved a 14.75% rate of reaching 65k with many built-in heuristics to encourage the snake-pattern (keeping the highest tile in the corner with tiles arranged in a descending zigzag), and endgame-only training environments that capitalized on it.</description>

These were my colleagues - thrown together by fate, or, more precisely, my employer.</description>

      <link>https://tomverbeure.github.io/2026/01/25/Notes-on-Basic-Polyphase-Decimation.html</link>
      <description>I’ve been reading up on polyphase filters and multi-rate digital signal processing.
It’s a broad topic, but as a beginner I need to start with the basics. And to better 
internalize those, I like to expand the generic math into concretely worked-out, 
smaller examples.</description>

      <link>https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2026/recapping-my-5-year-old-studio-monitors/</link>
      <description>A few weeks ago, I started hearing a slight crackle at the loudest parts of whenever sound was playing through my PreSonus Eris E3.5 speakers. It was very faint, but quite annoying, especially when editing my YouTube videos.
For a few days I thought it could be a hearing problem (at this point in my life, every year brings a new health adventure...), but after testing my wired headphones and another small computer speaker on the same output, I determined the problem was, indeed, coming from the PreSonus speakers.</description>
