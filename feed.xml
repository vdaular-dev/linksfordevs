      <title>I built a 2x faster lexer, then discovered I/O was the real bottleneck</title>

      <description>Archiving 104K files into tar.gz reduced I/O time by 43x and total processing time by 2.3x. The bottleneck was not disk speed, it was syscall overhead.</description>

      <title>Running Claude Code dangerously (safely)</title>
      <link>https://blog.emilburzo.com/2026/01/running-claude-code-dangerously-safely/</link>
      <description>Background I’ve been using Claude Code more and more recently. At some point I realized that rather than do something else until it finishes, I would constantly check on it to see if it was asking for yet another permission, which felt like it was missing the point of having an agent do stuff. So I wanted to use Claude Code with the --dangerously-skip-permissions flag.
If you haven’t used it, this flag does exactly what it says: it lets Claude Code do whatever it wants without asking permission first. No more “May I install this package?”, “Should I modify this config?”, “Can I delete these files?”
It just… does it.
Which is great for flow since I don’t have to worry that it stopped doing stuff just to ask a permission question.
But also, you know, dangerous.</description>
