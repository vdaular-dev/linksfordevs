      <link>https://www.appsoftware.com/blog/im-not-a-vibe-coder-but-when-i-am-this-is-my-set-up</link>
      <description>VS Code with Copilot is what I keep coming back to, and it's been improving all the time that I've been using it. Inline code completions is not particularly useful in my opinion (at worst, it's a distraction), but the Agentic AI chat has been very impressive when paired with Anthropic's Claude models.</description>

      <title>AlphaAgents: Multi-Agent A2A Implementation for Collaborative Financial Analysis</title>
      <link>https://c-daniele.github.io/en/posts/2025-08-31-alphaagents-a2a/</link>
      <description>1. Introduction The quantity of frameworks emerging for GenAI application development is incredible and, in my opinion, is becoming excessive. Every time a new framework appears, it seems to do more or less the same things as the previous one. Perhaps some have better modularization capabilities or more robust design against long-term obsolescence, but they all seem pretty much the same to me and, although I enjoy experimenting, the study of new miraculous and promising GenAI frameworks is becoming less and less appealing.</description>

      <title>The Essence of Prompt Engineering is the Art of Asking Questions</title>
      <link>https://ramsayleung.github.io/en/post/2025/the-essence-of-prompt-engineering-is-the-art-of-asking-questions/</link>
      <description>1 Introduction In today’s AI-driven world, “Prompt Engineer” has become a buzzword.
AI enthusiasts are eager to share prompts, study token control, and tweak temperature parameters.
The classic meme from Linux founder Linus Torvalds
Talk is cheap. Show me the code.
has evolved into:
Code is cheap. Show me the prompts.
Original tweet: https://x.com/tunguz/status/1856045530951917763?lang=en
But the core of effective AI interaction isn’t about technical jargon—it’s about how to ask questions effectively.</description>

      <title>Proof of Prompt</title>
      <link>https://cjauvin.github.io/posts/proof-of-prompt/</link>
      <description>When I’m doing freelance software development projects and I’m asked how much time things will take, it’s always very hard to answer. It’s a very high dimensional problem, and you have many degrees of freedom: how much should you charge, should you do it per hour or not, if you use AI how should it be factored in the efforts and time you report, what is the separation between the stuff that you charge and the stuff for which you don’t charge, does asking questions to your client to better understand the problem, on Slack in the weekend, count as time or not? Facing these doubts, and if they forgo the route of charging by the hour (which can be logistically quite painful, and can lead to its own kind of bad outcomes) I guess that most people are quite happy to fudge a rough number for a flat rate, do a couple of rounds of negotiation, reach an agreement, and call it a day. They implicitly accept that the outcome of this process can go both ways: either you estimated too low, and this way you will lose something, or the contrary. And you hope that in the grand scheme of things, things should average out in a reasonable way: either your loss, or their loss, who cares in the end? But is is really working this way?</description>
