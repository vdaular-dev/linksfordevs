      <title>Building an Visual Language Model from scratch</title>
      <link>https://poonai.xyz/posts/building-visual-language-model/</link>
      <description>My initial aim was to build a document processing model. But the idea was far fetched for my skill at the time. So, I settled down for building a toy version of visual language model for better understanding of VLM. I’m documenting my intuition for the benefit of myself and others. My model will receive image as an input and return its caption as an output. Luckily, I found a dataset with image and it’s caption to train.</description>

      <title>Why Three Replicas Are Better Than Two</title>
      <link>https://sookocheff.com/post/kubernetes/why-three-replicas-are-better-than-two/</link>
      <description>When deploying microservices on Kubernetes, how many replicas should I run? Intuition suggests that two replicas is enough to give you high availability; if one pod dies, the other keeps the service online. Industry standard, however, suggests running three replicas. Why is this the case?
In this post, I will explain reasons to choose three replicas over two, and some best practices based on the realities specific to Kubernetes.
The Math Behind Preferring Three Replicas The suggestion to run three replicas is often followed by hand-wavy “because it is more resilient”. Rather than rely on intuition, let’s try putting some numbers behind the reasoning.</description>

      <title>C++26: std::optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;</title>
      <link>https://www.sandordargo.com/blog/2025/10/01/cpp26-optional-of-reference</link>
      <description>If you’re a regular reader of my blog, you know I’ve been sharing what I learn about new C++ language and library features ever since C++20. You probably also read my CppCon 2025 Trip Report. And this post is where the two come together. At CppCon I attended a great talk by Steve Downey about std::optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;. Steve is the father of optional references—he co-authored P2988R12 with Peter Sommerlad. Let’s start with a little history. By now — at the end of 2025 — even C++17 feels like history. That’s when std::optional&lt;T&gt; was introduced, giving us a way to represent “maybe a value” with value semantics, instead of relying on pointers. But std::optional in C++17 (and later) couldn’t hold references — unless you wrapped them in std::reference_wrapper. C++26 finally fixes this gap. What is std::optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;? std::optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; has three key characteristics: Unlike std::optional&lt;T&gt;, it is not an owning type. It simply refers to an existing object. It provides both reference and value-like semantics. Internally, it behaves like a pointer to T, which may also be nullptr. This last point is interesting: while optional&lt;T&gt; can be seen as variant&lt;T, monostate&gt;, optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; is closer to variant&lt;T&amp;, nullptr_t&gt;. In practice, it’s a safer alternative to a non-owning raw pointer. Does this mean one less reason to use raw pointers? Well, owning raw pointers have been discouraged since C++11. Non-owning raw pointers are still common for expressing “I don’t own this.” With C++26, optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; might replace many of those cases. You’ll still need to check engagement, but at least it’s more expressive than sprinkling nullptr checks everywhere. Key considerations The design of std::optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; aimed for the least surprising and least dangerous behavior. Let’s walk through some of the decisions. Assign or Rebind? Consider this snippet (from Steve Downey’s CppCon talk): 1 2 3 4 5 6 Cat fynn; Cat loki; std::optional&lt;Cat&amp;&gt; maybeCat1; std::optional&lt;Cat&amp;&gt; maybeCat2{fynn}; maybeCat1 = fynn; maybeCat2 = loki; What should these assignments do? Should they copy objects or rebind references? If they were true assignments, maybeCat2 = loki; would copy loki into fynn. That would have been surprising and error-prone. Instead, the committee decided that operator= for optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; always rebinds the reference. At the end of the snippet: maybeCat1 refers to fynn maybeCat2 now refers to loki, not fynn. This design makes the behavior consistent and avoids accidental copies. What about make_optional()? make_optional() returns an optional&lt;T&gt;, not optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;. Even if you pass a reference, it still creates an owning optional. This is intentional: allowing make_optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; would lead to dangling references. In practice, make_optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; was mostly used in test cases. With C++26, you’ll need to construct optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; directly if you want an optional reference. It’s also worth noting that the main usage of make_optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; are tests cases. The question of constness Should optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; model shallow or deep const? For a const optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;, should operator*() and operator-&gt;() yield T&amp; or const T&amp;? The designers chose shallow constness: dereferencing a const optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; still gives you a non-const T&amp;. If you need deep constness, you can use optional&lt;const T&amp;&gt;. The least dangerous value_or What about value_or? For optional&lt;T&gt;, it returns a T. For optional&lt;T&amp;&gt;, the safest design turned out to be the same: value_or returns a T (by value). This avoids surprising reference semantics, and it supports common use cases like providing a literal fallback: 1 auto name = maybeName.value_or("Anonymous"s); Steve also mentions in the paper future proposals for free functions like reference_or, value_or, or_invoke, and yield_if for all optional-like types. Stay tuned — I’ll probably cover those here soon. Conclusion std::optional&lt;T&amp;&gt; fills an important gap in the language. It gives us a safer and more expressive way to model maybe-a-reference, reducing our reliance on raw pointers and reference wrappers. It’s another step toward making code both more readable and less error-prone — two things I’m always happy to see in modern C++.

      <description>Joshua Rogers sent us a *massive* list of potential issues in #curl that he found using his set of AI assisted tools. Code analyzer style nits all over. Mostly smaller bugs, but still bugs and there could be one or two actual security flaws in there. Actually truly awesome findings.

I have already landed 22(!) bugfixes thanks to this, and I have over twice that amount of issues left to go through. Wade through perhaps.

      <title>How AMD Stole Intel’s Future: The Untold x86-64 Story</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=WyX8TO3awfw</link>
      <description>Dave explains X64 and how AMD was able to beat Intel at its own game with its own instruction set!  AMD didn’t beat Intel by breaking x86—they won by perfecting it. This episode tells the inside story of how Itanium’s compiler-driven dream stumbled, and how AMD’s x86-64 quietly fixed the pain points that strangled 32-bit—more registers, RIP-relative code, a sane calling convention, NX/DEP, and fast SYSCALLs—while keeping 32-bit apps running through WOW64. We follow the Windows NT port as it shifts from theory to throughput, why K8’s integrated memory controller and HyperTransport mattered, and how Intel ultimately adopted the very ISA AMD created. Along the way we unpack what developers had to change (and what they didn’t), why many apps got faster even without giant pointers, and how security and driver quality leveled up in the transition.</description>

      <description>Back in 2018 I had the idea to prerender short segments of river bends and confluences into a texture, and then use that texture to draw the rivers to the screen. I was trying to have draw exactly one triangle per Delaunay triangle, so that I could generate the geometry ahead of time and only change the texture coordinates. I planned to implement this[1] as a 2D table:</description>

      <title>Lottery economics -Louis-André Labadie</title>
      <link>https://louis-andre.net/journal/lottery-economics</link>
      <description>Where I live, the national loto company, Loto-Québec, regularly run campaigns reminding players to sign their tickets or scratch cards when they play. Ostensibly, this protects the winner – in some minimal way – but the back of every ticket is also a contract with Loto Québec. That contract states that, essentially, a winner is not entitled to receive their prize unless they allow Loto Québec to run news and ads featuring them.</description>

      <title>Development gets better with Age</title>
      <link>https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2025/10/better-with-age.html</link>
      <description>He has heard the whispers, “he is getting older, who will replace him?” People asking him with a straight face, “when will you retire?” After close to 25 years at Amazon, where each year has been different and amazing, He feels as young as the day he decided to leave academia and join Amazon.
The thing about getting older as a developer, is that you have seen a lot and encountered many of the problems younger developers are facing (even if they look a little different on first glance). If you’ve been around the block as many times as some of us have, you’ll have earned battle scars along the way. There are days in war rooms you will never forget. You have experimented a lot, and you have failed more times than you care to remember. You have half-a-head full of what is practical and works. And a quarter of that space has been trained to look for red flags, scanning for things that you know will go wrong.</description>

      <description>Have you ever wondered how hard it is to make an AI talk to an API? Wouldn’t it be great if I could talk to a machine like Captain Picard does to his computer?
“Tea. Earl Grey. Hot!” would have to sent to the replicator subsystem with the correct instructions. But how would that actually work? I suppose, the Starship Enterprise-D made its first appearance on the airwaves in 1987. So at the time I guess we could expect a replicator to be programmed in C.</description>
