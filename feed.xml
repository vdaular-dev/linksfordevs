      <title>Presentations are products: a Next.js approach to slide decks</title>
      <link>https://burnedchris.com/blog/presentations-are-products</link>
      <description>I built our presentation system as a fully featured Next.js site, not a slide deck. At first it was for our own investor pitch, but it quickly became clear this approach works anywhere a company needs to tell its story: pitch decks, sales decks, product demos, internal talks.</description>

      <title>Nested string interpolation in Groovy - Tom's thoughts</title>
      <link>https://www.tomisawesome.com/thoughts/2025/09/25/nested-string-interpolation-in-groovy/</link>
      <description>So we're going to go down a little rabbit hole regarding groovy string interpolation which I found odd enough to want to write up. First, some basics. Groovy uses string interpolation syntax similar to bash, which looks like this: String foo = 'I am a fancy string' println("My string: ${foo}") Pretty straightforward, with a few</description>

      <title>My Homelab Setup</title>
      <link>https://dexteroot.net/posts/2025/07/my-homelab-setup/</link>
      <description>Intro I always wanted to have a homelab, where I can host applications and tinker with things. That dream has slowly materialized over the years, and I would like to showcase it here.
So currently, all my applications run on my Arch Linux machines. I am using Arch Linux mainly because I have spent considerable amount of time customising it. I learned Linux with Arch, and gained knowledge of systemd, the Linux filesystem, and manual package management via pacman. And as it has worked well for me all this time, I believe, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”</description>

      <title>Why The Double Dabble Algorithm Works</title>
      <link>https://yons.ch/posts/why-the-double-dabble-algorithm-works/</link>
      <description>When learning to program, students are often asked to implement a function that converts an integer to a string. Usually, what they come up with (and what they are expected to come up with) is to iteratively use division by 10 to get the digits of the number one by one. While this certainly works, division is considered an expensive operation, and so constrained systems (and perhaps standard implementations as well) use an algorithm called “Double Dabble” to get the decimal representation of a number.</description>

      <title>Bundler belongs to the Ruby community</title>
      <link>https://andre.arko.net/2025/09/25/bundler-belongs-to-the-ruby-community/</link>
      <description>I’ve spent 15 years of my life working on Bundler. When I introduce myself, people say “oh, the Bundler guy?”, and I am forced to agree.
I didn’t come up with the original idea for Bundler (that was Yehuda). I also didn’t work on the first six months worth of prototypes. That was all Carl and Yehuda together, back when “Carlhuda” was a super-prolific author of Ruby libraries, including most of the work to modularize Rails for version 3.</description>
