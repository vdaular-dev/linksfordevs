      <title>Apple to Soon Take Up to 30% Cut From All Patreon Creators in iOS App</title>
      <link>https://www.macrumors.com/2026/01/28/patreon-apple-tax/</link>
      <description>Apple has set a new deadline of November 1, 2026 for all Patreon creators to switch from Patreon's legacy billing system to the App Store's in-app purchase system in the Patreon app on the iPhone and iPad, as reported by TechCrunch. Note: This image has been edited to include a pile of cash. Patreon is a platform where creators such as YouTubers can receive payments from fans, which can be a valuable revenue stream alongside ads and sponsorships.</description>

      <title>or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Chaos</title>
      <link>https://charly-vibes.github.io/microdancing/en/posts/resonant-coding.html</link>
      <description>There’s a phenomenon that occurs when you stare too
                long at a screen full of code you don’t understand1. The brain starts
                doing something similar to what it does when you look at
                clouds: it searches for patterns, faces, familiar
                shapes. Except instead of seeing a rabbit or your Aunt
                Martha’s profile, you start seeing intentions. Purpose.
                A logic that surely must be there, that has to be there,
                because someone—or something—wrote it with some goal in
                mind. The problem is when that something is a language
                model and the goal was simply to generate the most
                probable sequence of characters given an input, which,
                if you stop to think about it with the seriousness it
                deserves, is a rather disturbing way to create the
                instructions that will move money, control systems,
                decide things.</description>

      <description>It’s after dinner on the holidays and you’re on call when a production system alarm starts to go off. After doing some initial investigation, you find that the issue is not a common one you or your team has encountered before, and there are few other collaborators around to turn to. Where do you even start? I was in this situation, and found coding agents to be surprisingly helpful for incident response!</description>

      <link>https://dwyer.co.za/static/the-worst-bug-ive-seen-in-claude-code.html</link>
      <description>I’ve been an advocate of pushing the boundaries of what people usually regard as ‘safe’ when it comes to coding agents. I’ve been running Claude and a few others locally and on some low-importance production servers with --dangerously-skip-permissions or equivalent since around June last year, and I’ve taken my eye off them even more since December when they saw a huge capability increase.</description>

      <title>Claude Code and executive function</title>
      <link>https://til.andrew-quinn.me/posts/claude-code-and-executive-function/</link>
      <description>I have a suspicion - and let me be clear, that’s all this is, a suspicion,
I am taking my own claims even more lightly than usual here - that Claude Code
makes most people’s lives better, but it makes the lives of those who struggle with executive
function much better.
When I have a problem to solve nowadays, I type c, then Enter. This alias opens up a fresh tmux
window with 4 separate instances of Claude Code. Then I just… pick one and describe the problem
I’m thinking about, and hit Enter again. The loop begins, and suddenly I am collaborating alongside
the closest thing to an IRL deus ex machina I’ve ever seen, for the cost of a few keystrokes.</description>
