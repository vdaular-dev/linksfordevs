      <title>Don't waste your back pressure ·</title>
      <link>https://banay.me/dont-waste-your-backpressure/</link>
      <description>Back pressure for agents
You might notice a pattern in the most successful applications of agents over the last year. Projects that are able to
setup structure around the agent itself, to provide it with automated feedback on quality and correctness, have been able
to push them to work on longer horizon tasks.
This back pressure helps the agent identify mistakes as it progresses and models are now good enough that this feedback
can keep them aligned to a task for much longer. As an engineer, this means you can increase your leverage by delegating
progressively more complex tasks to agents, while increasing trust that when completed they are at a satisfactory standard.</description>

      <title>Hardware for local coding models is still affordable. For how long?</title>
      <link>https://mitjamartini.com/posts/2026/01/hardware-for-local-coding-models-still-affordable/</link>
      <description>The recent RAM price hikes have pushed GPU prices up as well. The only systems that have not yet been affected to the same extent are Macs and high-end GPUs (RTX 6000 Pro and above). However, I would already classify GPUs as out of reach: running coding models with sufficiently large context windows would require one or two RTX 6000 Pro cards, or three to six RTX 5090s.
Let’s take a look at Macs instead.
Price Mem Bandwidth CPU RAM NVMe CPU GPU Model Price/Bandwidth Price/Memory 2.500 EUR 273 GB/s M4 Pro 64 GB 1 TB 12C 16C Mac Mini 9,15 EUR/GB/s 39,06 EUR/GB 4.027 EUR 546 GB/s M4 Max 128 GB 1 TB 16C 40C Mac Studio 7,14 EUR/GB/s 31,43 EUR/GB 4.200 EUR 800 GB/s M3 Ultra 96 GB 1 TB 28C 60C Mac Studio 5,52 EUR/GB/s 43,75 EUR/GB 6.720 EUR 800 GB/s M3 Ultra 256 GB 2 TB 28C 60C Mac Studio 8,40 EUR/GB/s 26,25 EUR/GB 11.900 EUR 800 GB/s M3 Ultra 512 GB 4 TB 32C 80C Mac Studio 14,87 EUR/GB/s 23,24 EUR/GB Mac Studios with the M3 Ultra currently offer the best overall value. The 96 GB version is fast, and its RAM capacity is sufficient to run many general-purpose models using quantization. The 256 GB version can handle coding models at reasonable quantization levels with 64k context, which is just about sufficient for running coding agents 1. The 512 GB model, however, exceeds the €10k, which I consider a hard upper limit for what can reasonably be called an “affordable” system.
The price difference between the 96 GB and 256 GB Mac Studio models is surprisingly close to current RAM market prices. For comparison, 256 GB of DDR5-6000 RAM currently costs around €3,430, or €13.39 per GB. The price delta between the 96 GB and 256 GB Mac Studio, and between the 256 GB and 512 GB versions, is approximately €12.88 per GB and €18.50 per GB, respectively. If Apple were to return to its usual memory pricing premiums, the 256 GB configuration would likely end up much closer to €10,000.
Hosted inference is both cheaper and more capable, but it cannot be used in all scenarios. In particular, freelancers and small companies are often required to rely on local systems when working for larger clients. The M3 Ultra, launched in March 2025, together with improved models, quantization techniques, and REAP, has effectively kicked off an era of affordable local coding models. That era may now enter a pause: RAM prices are expected to rise through 2026 and are likely to remain elevated until 2027 or 2028 2.

      <description>For some reason that I don't understand I've always been searching for something. This need to search has always been present within me but I can't quite put into words what it is that I'm searching for, whether I will ever find it, or if the search will ever finish. Well, I can always find words to describe it but they do a poor job and never capture the depth of what I want to find, if it's even possible to find: I'm always searching for the connection of how my humanity relates to the mystery of all the different lives that have ever lived.</description>

      <description>Introduction: In an era where our bank accounts, family photos, and work identities live behind a login screen, the phrase “it won’t happen to me” is no longer a security strategy. With billions of data points leaked every year, your digital safety isn’t determined by if your information will be exposed, but by how well you’ve prepared for when it happens. This article explores the common pitfalls of password management and introduces the one tool that makes “impossible” security easy for everyone: the Password Manager.</description>

      <title>Tech Promised Everything. Did it deliver? | Scott Hanselman | TEDxPortland</title>
      <link>https://youtube.com/watch?v=dVG8W-0p6vg</link>
      <description>The technology industry promised us connection, convenience, and creativity. Has it delivered, or offered false promises that may never be fully realized? Scott Hanselman offers a candid look at what’s really happening beneath the surface of AI and innovation and how we must make conscious, informed decisions about the tools shaping our future.

We could not do this without community support. With special thanks to the University of Oregon for their presenting partnership. The world-class stage production by For Good &amp; Co. The incredible legacy bound Event Book provided by Premier Press. Lastly, the brand identity and creative digital craft provided by our Agency of Record - Thesis. All of our Partners and event history can be found at TEDxPortland.com. Scott Hanselman is the VP of Developer Community at Microsoft and has spent over 30 years as a teacher, programmer, and prolific blogger. In addition to writing numerous technical books, Scott has produced nearly 2,000 episodes of his popular Hanselman Minutes and Azure Friday podcasts. A passionate technologist, he focuses on empowering developers and fostering inclusivity in tech. Scott frequently speaks at conferences worldwide, sharing insights on software development, productivity, and diversity in technology. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx</description>

      <title>How to Cut LLM Token Usage by 80% Using Recursive Document Analysis</title>
      <link>https://yogthos.net/posts/2026-01-16-lattice-mcp.html</link>
      <description>When you employ AI agents such as Claude, there’s a significant volume problem for document study. Reading one file of 1000 lines consumes about 10,000 tokens. Token consumption incurs costs and time penalties. Codebases with dozens or hundreds of files, a common case for real world projects, can easily exceed 100,000 tokens in size when the whole thing must be considered. The agent must read and comprehend, and be able to determine the interrelationships among these files. And, particularly, when the task requires multiple passes over the same documents, perhaps one pass to divine the structure and one to mine the details, costs multiply rapidly.</description>

      <title>I’m not a good enough engineer to code with LLMs – Kian.WTF</title>
      <link>https://kian.wtf/posts/ai_coding_thoughts</link>

I then was dealing with a chunking edge case and it also solved it perfectly.</description>
