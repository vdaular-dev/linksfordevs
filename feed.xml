      <title>Anthropic's 500 vulns are the tip of the iceberg</title>

      <description>Anthropic's red team found 500+ critical vulnerabilities with Claude. But they focused on maintained software. The scarier problem is the long tail that nobody will ever patch.</description>

      <title>How to Get Lucky: Focus On The Fat Tails</title>
      <link>https://taylorpearson.me/luck/</link>
      <description>Almost everyone systematically under-allocates resources to the fat tails. We tend to spend most of our time and energy thinking about the middle, because we see the world through a bell curve lens, and most of the area in a bell curve is in the middle. But in reality, we live in an 80/20 world, where the top 1% of fat tails account for 50% of the results. The people who understand this seem to attract luck, but really they’ve just adopted the 80/20 curve model.</description>

      <description>My residential internet gateway is a two-in-one optical network terminal (ONT) and home router. The gateway is configurable only through a web interface my ISP controls and they, unsurprisingly, expose very few gears and knobs for me to play with. This must be intentional on their part. They probably get a lot less tech support calls from people locking themselves out. I’m slightly annoyed about waiting 15 minutes for the DHCP lease list to update, but not annoyed enough to do anything about it. $60/month gets me 2 gbps up/down. That’s a great deal even if it means I can’t customize much.</description>

      <title>The software engineer identity crisis</title>
      <link>https://adamfletcher.com/writing/software-engineer-identity-crisis/</link>
      <description>Software engineering has changed forever. We're far from reaching AI-assisted programming's final form, but it's already clear that the majority of code produced will no longer involve a human typing it out. For some people that's an uncontroversial and obvious statement. Others will dismiss it as overhyping AI's utility.  Irrespective of where you fall on the pro-AI vs anti-AI spectrum, the change can be deeply unsettling when, until now, your job has been to write the code that AI is now generating.</description>

      <title>Rise of the Triforce</title>
      <link>https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2026/02/16/rise-of-the-triforce/</link>
      <description>During the rapid technological advancements of the early 1990s, the video game industry was on the cusp of a massive addition - another dimension. With console shenanigans like the Super FX chip giving players a taste of 3D, hype was at an all-time high. But the games released for home consoles were nothing compared to what arcade developers were capable of doing. By employing gigantic budgets and cutting-edge hardware, the arcade gave players a chance to see the future, today.
But the future eventually arrived with the launch of the 5th generation of consoles. All of a sudden, the revolutionary 3D hardware features that were once exclusive to arcades were now available in home consoles. Without next-generation hype pushing players into the arcade, powerful but expensive arcade machines were no longer sustainable to develop. The industry adjusted by moving toward more cost effective solutions, with many turning to the inexpensive, already proven 3D-capable hardware available in 5th gen home consoles.
Rather than turning around the decline of the arcade, the cheaper hardware may have helped accelerate it. There were fewer unique experiences to pull players into the arcade, and previous hit exclusives were now seeing high quality home console ports that allowed them to be enjoyed without munching quarters. When the 6th generation arrived with the Dreamcast and the PlayStation 2, many arcade stalwarts waved the white flag and started to shift their arcade divisions to home console projects, with mixed success.
Sega was among those hit hardest by this era. They produced some of the greatest arcade thrills of the 1990s and enjoyed massive success in the home console market with the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive. But a string of mistakes and miscalculations combined with the slumping arcade industry sent them to the brink of bankruptcy. By 2002, the Dreamcast had been soundly defeated by the launch of the PlayStation 2, and Sega began porting some of their hits to their former rivals' hardware just to stay afloat.
The home market was lost, but the languishing arcade scene presented Sega with an opportunity. They still had legendary arcade development teams, and if Sega could leverage them to produce a wave of arcade hits, they would be in a position to dominate a new era of arcades when most others were changing gears. There was just one problem: Sega didn't have the resources that they once did. If they were going to do this, they needed some help.
And so they did something that would have been considered unthinkable just five years prior. Sega teamed up with Nintendo to develop a GameCube-based arcade platform. Bolstering their ranks was Namco, another coin-op stalwart with tons of arcade veterans.
Three companies, one mission: Triforce.</description>

      <title>SkillsBench: Benchmarking How Well Agent Skills Work Across Diverse Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12670</link>
      <description>Agent Skills are structured packages of procedural knowledge that augment LLM agents at inference time. Despite rapid adoption, there is no standard way to measure whether they actually help. We present SkillsBench, a benchmark of 86 tasks across 11 domains paired with curated Skills and deterministic verifiers. Each task is evaluated under three conditions: no Skills, curated Skills, and self-generated Skills. We test 7 agent-model configurations over 7,308 trajectories. Curated Skills raise average pass rate by 16.2 percentage points(pp), but effects vary widely by domain (+4.5pp for Software Engineering to +51.9pp for Healthcare) and 16 of 84 tasks show negative deltas. Self-generated Skills provide no benefit on average, showing that models cannot reliably author the procedural knowledge they benefit from consuming. Focused Skills with 2--3 modules outperform comprehensive documentation, and smaller models with Skills can match larger models without them.</description>

      <title>Rob Panico - You Never See the Whole Shape at Once</title>
      <link>https://www.robpanico.com/articles/display/?entry_short=you-never-see-the-whole-shape-at-once</link>
      <description>A tesseract can never be seen all at once—only through partial, time-bound projections—and that limitation turns out to be the point. What looks contradictory from a single frame often reveals coherence when allowed to rotate over time. This essay uses the geometry of higher dimensions to explore why certainty fractures complex things, and why humility toward incomplete views is not weakness but structural necessity.</description>

      <title>On Dyslexia, Programming and Lisp. — Relections on Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://www.iwillig.me/blog/on-dyslexia-and-lisp/</link>
      <description>Dyslexia is a difference in the way the brain processes language. It is often defined as the difference between intelligence (vaguely defined via the fake IQ test) and a person's ability to read. That is, a dyslexic with normal intelligence will underperform compared to their peers in learning how to read. There are many different theories on what the cause is, but most people believe that there are fundamental differences between the brains of people who have dyslexia and those that do not. In Maryanne Wolf's book, Dyslexia, Fluency, and the Brain, several essays point to a physical difference in the density of specialized brain cells that the brain uses to process letter shapes. It has become clear recently from fMRIs that dyslexics actually develop unique neural pathways for reading that are located in the right side of the brain compared to the normal left-side-dominated reading pathways. However, a root cause has not been identified, and the jury is still out. Dyslexia varies considerably, with up to 15% of the population experiencing some form of it.</description>

      <title>A Love Letter to Self-Hosting</title>
      <link>https://lukaswerner.com/post/2026-02-13@self-hosting-letter</link>
      <description>I’ve tried to put to paper why I love self-hosting; yet I’ve never been fully able to accurately describe what I love about it. Perhaps it is the digital sovereignty, or the rejection of living on the internet and renting my space, or perhaps it is a way of feeling closer to the software I use. Either way it is something that matters a great deal to me.</description>

      <title>Words are a Leaky Abstraction</title>
      <link>https://brianschrader.com/archive/words-are-a-leaky-abstraction/</link>
      <description>Something about hearing the phrase "Claude's Soul Document" got me thinking again about a problem I've long pondered. Software folks, like myself, have a long and proud history of taking words that exist and coopting them, manipulating the meaning of those words into feeble shadows of their former selfs. Tech people and tech companies do this on accident and on purpose, both because it can be useful to reduce a human concept to something simpler to quantify and because its easier to market and sell. Machine Learning, an academic term, becomes Artificial Intelligence and the word "Intelligence" is defined down in order to be achievable.</description>
