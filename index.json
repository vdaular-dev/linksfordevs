This demo was distributed as a ~100 GB Unreal Engine scene - that can only be opened in a special branch of Unreal Engine, NvRTX. The demo showcased the application of new driver-exposed raytracing features, specifically clustered raytracing, in combination with Nanite clustered LOD pipeline - allowing to stream and display a very highly detailed scene with full raytracing without using the Nanite proxy meshes that Unreal Engine currently generates for raytracing.\n\nAs this was too Unreal Engine specific for me, I couldn’t really experiment much with this - but then, in early September, NVIDIA released an update to their vk_lod_clusters open-source sample, that - among other things - featured Zorah scene as a glTF file. Naturally, this piqued my curiosity - and led me to spend a fair amount of time to improve support for hierarchical clustered LOD in meshoptimizer.\n\n",
