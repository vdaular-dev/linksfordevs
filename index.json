    "Description": "TL;DR\nWe investigate a fundamental question in recurrent neural network training: why is backpropagation through time always ran backwards? We show, by deriving an exact gradient-based algorithm that propagates error forward in time (in multiple phases), that this does not necessarily need to be the case! However, while the math holds up, it suffers from critical numerical stability issues as the network forgets information faster.\nThis post details the derivation, the successful experiments, an analysis of why this promising idea suffers numerically, and the reasons why we did not investigate it further.",
