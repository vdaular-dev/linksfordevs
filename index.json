The idea for this project is then to fine-tune a diffusion model to include my face in the generated images. Then, I can generate a bunch in different wacky situations/styles, and randomize then in the first page of the website, including the caption used to generate it. Of course, by now models are so big and smart that finetuning to do this is quite overkill: I could simply provide my picture to chatGPT, and ask it to incorporate it in some images, and it would probably work better. Still, its a good learning opportunity, which is as usual the main goal of my projects.",

Individual humans\n\n2. Small organized groups of humans (e.g., close or extended family; friends; local social or religious organizations; informal sports clubs; small businesses and non-profits; ad hoc collaborations on small projects; small online communities)\n\n3. Large organized groups of humans (e.g., large companies; governments; global institutions; professional sports clubs; large political parties or movements; large social media sites)\n\n4. Large complex systems (e.g., the global economy; the environment; the geopolitical climate; popular culture and \"viral\" topics; the collective state of science and technology).\n\n(1/5)",
