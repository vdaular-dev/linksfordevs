I can clearly see how AI coding is rewiring our brains – it makes developers crave instant gratification instead of deep understanding, and reduces us to gamblers who pull levers for the next hit of working code. If this is happening to me, someone who learned to code in the pre-AI era, what’s it doing to junior developers who’ve never known anything else?",

The 90s and 00s demoscene was filled with incredible sights & sounds for the senses, but none more incredible (in my opinion) than kkrieger; a playable 3D FPS that compacts into just 96KB created by German demo group Farbrausch (theprodukkt).
