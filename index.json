    "Description": "When I was a junior engineer, my manager would occasionally confide his frustrations to me in our weekly 1:1s. He would point out a project another team was working on and say, “I don’t believe that project will go anywhere, they’re solving the wrong problem.” I used to wonder, “But you are very senior, why don’t you just go and speak to them about your concerns?” It felt like a waste of his influence to not say anything.\nSo it’s quite ironic that I found myself last week explaining to a mentee why I thought a sister team’s project would have to pivot because they’d made a poor early design choice. And he rightfully asked me the same question I had years ago: “why don’t you just tell them your opinion?” It’s been on my mind ever since because I realized I’d changed my stance on it a lot over the years.",

AI errors are different from human errorshuman mistakes tend to be low-to-medium severity — typos, minor logic flaws, a missing null check. messy but catchable.AI mistakes are disproportionately high-severity: injection flaws, authentication bypasses, catastrophic failure modes. the code is syntactically perfect and passes the eye test. but it fails catastrophically on adversarial inputs.2. the hallucinated abstraction problemthis is the scariest part.LLMs don't just write bad code. they invent entirely new \"mini-frameworks\" that look sophisticated but are fundamentally broken.example from the study: an LLM asked to help filter database records generated a clean, PEP-8 compliant \"SQL builder\" function. modern f-strings. clear variable names. looked professional.it was a textbook SQL injection vulnerability. no escaping. no prepared statements. no validation.the developer accepted it because it worked functionally. they didn't realize the AI had replaced a battle-tested library with a fragile, hallucinated utility.radware calls this the \"abstraction hallucination multiplier\" — the AI invents helper functions that simply don't exist or are non-functional placeholders. traditional security tools don't catch it because the function call is valid syntax, even if the implementation is broken.3. the ouroboros effectLLMs learn from code published online. more and more of that code is now AI-generated. so:AI generates flawed codeflawed code gets published to github/stackoverflownext-generation LLMs train on that flawed codemodels become experts at reproducing their own statistical flawsthe security baseline of all generated code is permanently declining. radware calls it \"poisoning the well.\"4. attackers are already exploiting thisthe study found attackers are using \"AI-fingerprinting\" — hunting for unique code signatures that only LLMs produce.when thousands of developers use the same prompt, they get the same vulnerable boilerplate. one exploit works on thousands of unrelated systems.even worse: \"slopsquatting.\" attackers monitor LLM output for hallucinated package names (packages that don't exist). then they register those names on npm/pypi with malicious payloads.developer gets a dependency error. runs npm install hallucinated-package. installs the attacker's payload.this is happening now.linus can vibe code. you probably can't.when linus torvalds uses AI to help with linux kernel development, that's not \"vibe coding.\" that's 30+ years of context, taste, and architecture sense — amplified.AI multiplies what you already know.10 years of experience × AI = 10x output0 years of experience × AI = 10x slopthe modular algorithm initialize the comprehensive compatibility using robust algorithm through modularJoin to see! it.or review it.or debug it at 3am.or defend it against an attacker who knows exactly what the LLM got wrong.what this means for your SaaSif you're building a product, this matters more than you think.1. your dependencies are maintained by volunteersthose volunteers are burning out. AI-generated PRs are accelerating it.when left-pad disappeared in 2016, it broke thousands of builds. the next left-pad won't disappear because someone unpublished it. it'll disappear because the maintainer quietly walked away after reviewing their 50th slop PR.2. your AI-assisted hires might be hollowthat \"open source contributor\" on the resume? might be rejected PRs and linkedin screenshots.that impressive take-home project? might be AI-generated slop they can't explain.new interview question: \"walk me through a bug you personally debugged in this code.\"3. your codebase is already accumulating debtthe contractor story — 100k lines pruned — is happening everywhere. quietly. the code works today. the debt compounds tomorrow.cory doctorow called it: \"Tech Debt at Scale.\"4. your security surface just expandedif your team is using AI to write code, you now have synthetic vulnerabilities. the question is how many, and whether your security tools can even detect them.traditional SAST tools miss hallucinated abstractions. they see valid function calls, not broken implementations.radware's conclusion: \"we must stop acting as passive consumers of AI-generated code and transition into security auditors.\"what actually workstalked to maintainers and engineering leads who haven't burned out yet.for open source maintainers:disclosure checkbox: \"Was this PR generated with AI assistance? If yes, describe what you personally reviewed and tested.\"issue-first policy: no PR without a linked issue that was discussed first. kills drive-by \"improvements.\"close faster: stop explaining. if it looks like slop, close immediately. your time is worth more than their feelings.for hiring managers:debug interviews: give them their own submitted code with a bug injected. watch them find it.explain-the-trade-off: \"why did you use X instead of Y here?\" vibe coders can't answer this.check the PRs: if they claim open source contributions, look at whether they were merged.for founders:audit your AI-written code: not whether it works. whether someone else can maintain it. whether it has synthetic vulnerabilities.watch for the pattern: fast output, can't explain decisions, every review comment triggers a complete rewrite.build review culture: the cost of catching slop early is 10x cheaper than pruning 100k lines later.update your security tooling: if you're not scanning for hallucinated abstractions, you're not scanning for AI vulnerabilities.the uncomfortable truthAI-assisted coding works great for:personal projectsprototypeslearningthrowaway scriptsexperienced developers who can review what they generateAI-assisted coding destroys:collaborative codebases (when contributors can't review their own output)open source projects (when maintainers bear the review cost)anything someone else has to debuganything that needs to be securethe problem isn't AI. the problem is the 12x cost asymmetry.you save 7 minutes. the maintainer loses 85.the bottom linethe developers who thrive won't be the ones who generate the most code. they'll be the ones who can tell the difference between code that compiles and code that belongs.taste scales. slop doesn't.sources:radware threat intelligence: synthetic vulnerabilitiescory doctorow on \"tech debt at scale\"maintainer interviews and reddit/HN discussionswhat are you seeing? maintainers — how are you handling the review load? founders — have you caught AI-generated slop in your codebase?irony, adding an ai-gen image myself:#CaseStudy #VibeCoding",
