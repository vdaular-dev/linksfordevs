As a Goland aficionado, I (and my wrist) have always been tempted by no-mouse, OSS, gopls based, highly configurable dev setups.",

As a result, I decreased the cyclomatic complexity from 24 to 0 and reduced development time from hours to minutes.\nThe rest of this post is organized as follows sections:\n\nThe problem explains the problem I was solving.\nCreating the bit mask field presents a solution to the problem.\nCyclomatic Complexity discusses cyclomatic complexity and calculates this metric for the solution presented in the section above.\nBuilder design pattern explains the builder design pattern and describes the refactoring process that removed complexity.\nConclusion summarizes this post.\nReferences provides references related to the topics discussed here.\n\nAll the examples shown here are in C++.",
