Or is this just clickbait fear-mongering? In this video, we break down:\nWhy early programmers panicked when Grace Hopper introduced compilers\nHow AI tools like ChatGPT compare to human intelligence\nThe repeating cycles of hype and disappointment in AI history\nWhy software development is far from fully automatable\nThe risks of pivoting careers based on AI “doom predictions”\nAI is a tool, not a replacement—for now. Understand the trends, separate hype from reality, and make informed career decisions.\n\n\nSources:\nhttps://youtu.be/HD0L3lQ9cms?si=4skwzUgqKYMHC9Op",
