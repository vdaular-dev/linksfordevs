At the end of the challenge, you should be comfortable creating games in your engine of choice without a tutorial.\nIf you do everything yourself during the challenge, then you will have practice estimating, planning, programming, and polishing your game. You’ll also be able to create the music, sound effects, 2D, and 3D art that you’ll need.",
