A dedicated device keeps the blast radius away from anything I actually care about.\nSystem specs Link to heading Board: NVIDIA Jetson Nano (4GB) CPU: Quad-core ARM Cortex-A57 (ARMv8) RAM: 4GB LPDDR4 Storage: 128GB eMMC OS: Ubuntu 18.04.6 LTS (JetPack R32.1.0) Kernel: 4.9.140-tegra Connection: SSH over local network, HDMI to external projector The Nano runs Ubuntu 18.04 with a 4.9 kernel — NVIDIA’s last supported JetPack for this hardware.
