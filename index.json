A specific user space driver requires a specific kernel driver. For drivers in Mesa, this isn’t an issue. In the medium term, we might get lucky here and the Mesa-provided Nova driver might become competitive with the proprietary driver. Not all hardware will be supported though, and some people might need CUDA or other proprietary features, so this problem likely won’t go away completely.",
