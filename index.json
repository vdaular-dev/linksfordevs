It’s a very high dimensional problem, and you have many degrees of freedom: how much should you charge, should you do it per hour or not, if you use AI how should it be factored in the efforts and time you report, what is the separation between the stuff that you charge and the stuff for which you don’t charge, does asking questions to your client to better understand the problem, on Slack in the weekend, count as time or not? Facing these doubts, and if they forgo the route of charging by the hour (which can be logistically quite painful, and can lead to its own kind of bad outcomes) I guess that most people are quite happy to fudge a rough number for a flat rate, do a couple of rounds of negotiation, reach an agreement, and call it a day. They implicitly accept that the outcome of this process can go both ways: either you estimated too low, and this way you will lose something, or the contrary. And you hope that in the grand scheme of things, things should average out in a reasonable way: either your loss, or their loss, who cares in the end? But is is really working this way?",
