    "Description": "The scale of the cheating crisis in higher education is staggering. Depending on the survey, between 60% and 92% of college students now regularly use AI for their coursework. Professors are ill-equipped, and administrators are broadly turning a blind eye to the entire situation. Treating this as wholly the fault of AI is, however, a grave mistake.\nThe truth is that education has been broken for a long time, and AI was the accelerant that made the bonfire bright enough to see from a distance. In a system where degrees now primarily function as an expensive IQ screening mechanism, where learning is wholly secondary to certification, and where industrial-age teaching methods clash with information-age realities, AI has finally revealed the plastered-over fractures that have been growing for decades.",
