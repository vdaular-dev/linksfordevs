    "Description": "When I asked ChatGPT what it remembered about me, it listed 33 facts from my name and career goals to my current fitness routine. But how does it actually store and retrieve this information? And why does it feel so seamless?\nAfter extensive experimentation, I discovered that ChatGPT’s memory system is far simpler than I expected. No vector databases. No RAG over conversation history. Instead, it uses four distinct layers: session metadata that adapts to your environment, explicit facts stored long-term, lightweight summaries of recent chats, and a sliding window of your current conversation.",
