I'm Nick, and in this video, we will talk about the recent LTS and STS change that Microsoft introduced for .NET. The lifecycle support is a common issue that .NET developers raise, mainly around how short it is, but there was another issue that you might not know about.\n\nDon't forget to comment, like and subscribe :)\n\nSocial Media:\nFollow me on GitHub: https://github.com/Elfocrash\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/nickchapsas\nConnect on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-chapsas\n\n#csharp #dotnet",
