    "Description": "Lately I’ve been reading Sean Goedecke’s essays on being a Staff+ engineer. His work (particularly Software engineering under the spotlight and It’s Not Your Codebase) is razor-sharp and feels painfully familiar to anyone in Big Tech.\nOn paper, I fit the mold he describes: I’m a Senior Staff engineer at Google. Yet, reading his work left me with a lingering sense of unease. At first, I dismissed this as cynicism. After reflecting, however, I realized the problem wasn’t Sean’s writing but my reading.\nSean isn’t being bleak; he is accurately describing how to deal with a world where engineers are fungible assets and priorities shift quarterly. But my job looks nothing like that and I know deep down that if I tried to operate in that environment or in the way he described I’d burn out within months.\nInstead I’ve followed an alternate path, one that optimizes for systems over spotlights, and stewardship over fungibility.",

    "Description": "This is the hunt for the only known 1969 Pontiac 2+2 convertible to leave the factory with a Corvette-spec 427 and a four-speed—born in Canada, hiding Chevy bones under Pontiac skin, and scattered across an Alberta farm in coffee cans. We follow the trail from my dad’s bubble-top Parisienne to a barn-find basket case, through mirrored Protect-O-Plate forensics, lost-and-found VIN tags, and an eight-year, concours-level resurrection that dyno-verifies 390 honest horsepower.\n\nIf you love deep cuts—Canadian tariffs, Wide-Track myths, Chevy chassis in Pontiac clothing, NOS treasure hunting, and the moment a ghost car rolls back into the light—this one pays off. Stick around to the end to see the “Holy Grail Pontiac” reborn and the paper trail that proves it existed at all.\n\nFree Sample of my Book on the Spectrum: https://amzn.to/3zBinWM\n\nCode: https://github.com/PlummersSoftwareLLC/retropad\n\nBlack Friday Affiliate Links!!

    "Timestamp": "2025-12-04T15:02:09",
    "Domain": "arxiv.org",
    "Description": "In democracies, major policy decisions typically require some form of majority or consensus, so elites must secure mass support to govern. Historically, elites could shape support only through limited instruments like schooling and mass media; advances in AI-driven persuasion sharply reduce the cost and increase the precision of shaping public opinion, making the distribution of preferences itself an object of deliberate design. We develop a dynamic model in which elites choose how much to reshape the distribution of policy preferences, subject to persuasion costs and a majority rule constraint. With a single elite, any optimal intervention tends to push society toward more polarized opinion profiles - a ``polarization pull'' - and improvements in persuasion technology accelerate this drift. When two opposed elites alternate in power, the same technology also creates incentives to park society in ``semi-lock'' regions where opinions are more cohesive and harder for a rival to overturn, so advances in persuasion can either heighten or dampen polarization depending on the environment. Taken together, cheaper persuasion technologies recast polarization as a strategic instrument of governance rather than a purely emergent social byproduct, with important implications for democratic stability as AI capabilities advance.",
