    "Description": "As games become more and more complex and the unified graphics API problem remains unsolved, one of the main problematics when making games and engines is how you handle multi-platform graphics API code. Over the years, we have seen a few APIs enter the scene trying to rule them all, but it seems like in the year 2025, this problem is still present.\nBefore we had the modern graphics APIs of today, we had OpenGL - a unified API, a global state, it worked everywhere and was very easy to use. However, as the years passed, and as the hardware evolved, more graphics APIs came into play. We had Direct3D, whose 11th iteration is still popular to this day in some engines, and almost 10 years ago, the arrival of Vulkan, D3D12 and Metal. Slowly but surely, OpenGL also started to fade away in the professional game engine space as it had too much driver overhead and was messier to use than newer APIs, that also exposed more features (raytracing especially).",
