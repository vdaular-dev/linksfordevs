    "Description": "EF Core Database Provider for Azure Data Explorer (Kusto). GitHub     The project that I work on has a lot of data, in a lot of entities with a lot of fields, all exposed through an OData API. Naturally, that compels us to know exactly what kind of query shapes our users may be interested in and to create optimal indexes for them beforehand. However, there’s literally hundreds of fields and creating an index for every single one of them is simply not an option. Timeouts are great for protecting the database from maliciously demanding queries but they don’t offer much in the realm of user-experience. We need to allow clients to send arbitrary queries and we need them to be fast regardless of whether we’re expecting said query or not. It was clear to me that we needed a solution and not an optimization and so I considered exploring Big Data solutions and columnar databases. Since our infrastructure is primarily Azure-based, my boss suggested that we explore Azure Data Explorer (ADX) aka Kusto. In a couple of days, ingestion was complete and a little testing showed promising performance so we decided to explore our options for integration. Sadly, Kusto not only doesn’t have an EF Core provider package, the T-SQL support, although well-marketed, was poorly performing. It was very clear to us that this path would require a little investment. After discovering that EFCore.Snowflake, another library/database pair we considered using, is developed and maintained by one person alone, I felt motivated to take a crack at writing a database provider. I mean, how hard could it be in today’s AI powered era?",
