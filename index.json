Scaling is still one of the most important ways to improve the intelligence efficiency of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Compared to GLM-4.5, GLM-5 scales from 355B parameters (32B active) to 744B parameters (40B active), and increases pre-training data from 23T to 28.5T tokens. GLM-5 also integrates DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), significantly reducing deployment cost while preserving long-context capacity.",
