    "Description": "In this session recorded at Unreal Fest Stockholm, we take a look at the new features of the improved GPU profiler that shipped with UE 5.6, and how the extra information it provides can help when profiling titles for both CPU and GPU performance. \n\nWe also take a deep dive on our modern RHI submission pipeline design. This system is responsible for the threading of renderer work on the CPU, and feeding that work to the GPU. \n\nWatch to learn about the modern Unreal Engine renderer threading design, which is valuable when analysing Unreal Insights traces for rendering related performance issues.\n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine here: unrealengine.com\n\n#GPUProfiler, #RHISubmissionPipeline, #UnrealInsights, #UnrealEngine, #UE5.6, #UnrealFestStockholm",
