    "Description": "Early this year, NVIDIA released their new raytracing technology, RTX Mega Geometry, alongside an impressive Zorah demo. This demo was distributed as a ~100 GB Unreal Engine scene - that can only be opened in a special branch of Unreal Engine, NvRTX. The demo showcased the application of new driver-exposed raytracing features, specifically clustered raytracing, in combination with Nanite clustered LOD pipeline - allowing to stream and display a very highly detailed scene with full raytracing without using the Nanite proxy meshes that Unreal Engine currently generates for raytracing.\n\nAs this was too Unreal Engine specific for me, I couldn’t really experiment much with this - but then, in early September, NVIDIA released an update to their vk_lod_clusters open-source sample, that - among other things - featured Zorah scene as a glTF file. Naturally, this piqued my curiosity - and led me to spend a fair amount of time to improve support for hierarchical clustered LOD in meshoptimizer.\n\n",

Imagine you come up with an elegant solution to a problem you’ve been tackling all day, or maybe even the whole past week. You can’t wait to implement and test your solution. And of course, you are so driven by your idea that you decide to continue working despite your working day being over. “20 minutes more and I will finish it,” you think. Obviously, this is not the case; some edge cases and new issues will inevitably arise. You come to your senses only 2–3 hours later—tired, hungry, demotivated, and still struggling with your problem. You just wasted your evening, with nothing to show for it. Worse, you overworked and didn’t recover that night. Thus, you were already exhausted when you started working.",
