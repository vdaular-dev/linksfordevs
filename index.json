One grandparent survived the horrors of Auschwitz; the others endured similarly harrowing circumstances during the war. In their homes, education wasn’t a luxury—it was an impossibility. Consequently, my parents grew up with little academic guidance, eventually finding themselves in blue-collar roles that left them feeling financially precarious.",
