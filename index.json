Token consumption incurs costs and time penalties. Codebases with dozens or hundreds of files, a common case for real world projects, can easily exceed 100,000 tokens in size when the whole thing must be considered. The agent must read and comprehend, and be able to determine the interrelationships among these files. And, particularly, when the task requires multiple passes over the same documents, perhaps one pass to divine the structure and one to mine the details, costs multiply rapidly.",

In order to get a short-lived certificate subscribers simply need to select the ‘shortlived’ certificate profile in their ACME client.\nShort-lived certificates improve security by requiring more frequent validation and reducing reliance on unreliable revocation mechanisms. If a certificate’s private key is exposed or compromised, revocation has historically been the way to mitigate damage prior to the certificate’s expiration. Unfortunately, revocation is an unreliable system so many relying parties continue to be vulnerable until the certificate expires, a period as long as 90 days. With short-lived certificates that vulnerability window is greatly reduced.\n",
