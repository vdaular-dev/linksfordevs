    "Description": "Some loosely organized thoughts on the current Zeitgeist.  They were inspired by the response to my recent meta-project mentioned in my previous post https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115254145226514817, where within 24 hours I became aware of a large number of ongoing small-scale collaborative math projects with their own modest but active community (now listed at https://mathoverflow.net/questions/500720/list-of-crowdsourced-math-projects-actively-seeking-participants ); but they are from the perspective of a human rather than a mathematician.\n\nAs a crude first approximation, one can think of human society as the interaction between entities at four different scales:\n\n1. Individual humans\n\n2. Small organized groups of humans (e.g., close or extended family; friends; local social or religious organizations; informal sports clubs; small businesses and non-profits; ad hoc collaborations on small projects; small online communities)\n\n3. Large organized groups of humans (e.g., large companies; governments; global institutions; professional sports clubs; large political parties or movements; large social media sites)\n\n4. Large complex systems (e.g., the global economy; the environment; the geopolitical climate; popular culture and \"viral\" topics; the collective state of science and technology).\n\n(1/5)",
