    "Description": "Ever wanted to code a game from scratch that runs on an old retro computer hardware from 1985 ? Challenge Accepted - This is my Work in Progress port of Zippy Race that runs on a standard Commodore Amiga A500 with the Original Chip Set (OCS) and just 512k/512k. In this episode I walk through how the port came to be and how I solved various challenges with the development of the game.

Those run in WASM on the client side (which I&rsquo;ll write about in Part 2 because that setup was wild).",
