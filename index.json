    "Description": "16 April 1963\nMy Dear Fellow Clergymen:\nWhile confined here in the Birmingham city jail, I came across your recent statement\ncalling\nmy present activities \"unwise and untimely.\" Seldom do I pause to answer criticism of my\nwork and\nideas. If I sought to answer all the criticisms that cross my desk, my secretaries would\nhave little time\nfor anything other than such correspondence in the course of the day, and I would have no\ntime for\nconstructive work. But since I feel that you are men of genuine good will and that your\ncriticisms are\nsincerely set forth, I want to try to answer your statement in what I hope will be patient\nand\nreasonable terms.",

Professors are ill-equipped, and administrators are broadly turning a blind eye to the entire situation. Treating this as wholly the fault of AI is, however, a grave mistake.\nThe truth is that education has been broken for a long time, and AI was the accelerant that made the bonfire bright enough to see from a distance. In a system where degrees now primarily function as an expensive IQ screening mechanism, where learning is wholly secondary to certification, and where industrial-age teaching methods clash with information-age realities, AI has finally revealed the plastered-over fractures that have been growing for decades.",
