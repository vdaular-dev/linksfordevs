One of these tools is dotnet-trace: a tool that can be hooked into a running .NET application to collect tracing data which can then be analysed with trace viewers.",

    "Description": "This article is continuation to: Was it really a Billion Dollar Mistake?.\nAfter reading a lot of the comments on numerous social media sites on the original article, I think I need to clarify a lot more.\nThe main points I wanted to clarify:\nNull pointer dereferences are empirically the easiest class of invalid memory addresses to catch at runtime, and are the least common kind of invalid memory addresses that happen in memory unsafe languages. I do think it was a costly mistake but the “obvious solutions” to the problem are probably just as costly, if not more so, but in very subtle ways which most people neglected to understand in the article1. I think that even if Tony Hoare didn’t “invent” NULL pointers, within a couple years someone else would have. I don’t think it’s a “mistake” the programming world was ever going to avoid. I am talking about languages that run on modern systems with virtual memory, not embedded systems where you interact with physical memory directly. Those platforms in my opinion need much different kinds of languages which unfortunately do not exist yet. I was also talking about languages akin to C and Odin, not languages that run on a VM or have “everything be a reference”. Languages where Everything is a Pointer A lot of commentors based their complaints in their experience with languages like Java/C#/Python/etc, and the issues with null-pointer-exceptions (NPEs) in them. What I think a lot of people seemed to forget is that in those languages, virtually everything is a pointer, unlike in a language like C/Go/Odin which has explicit pointers. When everything is a pointer, it is exponentially more likely that you will hit a pointer that is invalid. And in the case of a managed (garbage collected) language, that invalid pointer will most definitely be a null pointer. This is why I can understand the problem of having null pointers in such languages.",
