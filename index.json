Managing multiple conversations, maintaining context across sessions, and ensuring quality all require different approaches than single-session work.\nThis series documents those problems and the solutions that emerged. The tools shown use Claude Code and Emacs, but the patterns apply broadly to any LLM workflow.",

This demo was distributed as a ~100 GB Unreal Engine scene - that can only be opened in a special branch of Unreal Engine, NvRTX. The demo showcased the application of new driver-exposed raytracing features, specifically clustered raytracing, in combination with Nanite clustered LOD pipeline - allowing to stream and display a very highly detailed scene with full raytracing without using the Nanite proxy meshes that Unreal Engine currently generates for raytracing.\n\nAs this was too Unreal Engine specific for me, I couldn’t really experiment much with this - but then, in early September, NVIDIA released an update to their vk_lod_clusters open-source sample, that - among other things - featured Zorah scene as a glTF file. Naturally, this piqued my curiosity - and led me to spend a fair amount of time to improve support for hierarchical clustered LOD in meshoptimizer.\n\n",
