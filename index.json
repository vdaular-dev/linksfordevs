They fall into a few categories: the mathematics of data privacy, popular mathematics, politics, and nineteenth century philosophy. For data privacy, we look at how technical details may be hindering adoption of differential privacy as well as scaling laws for differentially private language models. Next, we look at excellent popular math articles introducing the Collatz conjecture and the Busy Beaver numbers. In politics, we explore paranoid eighteenth century political rhetoric as well as John Maynard Keynes’ reflections on the Liberal party after a disastrous election in 1924. Finally, we look at two philosophical movements in mid-nineteenth century America and an 1875 article on the relation between the verifiability and discoverability of truths.\n\n",

This document serves as a companion to the official specification, offering deeper insight into the model's development and more detailed implementation guidance, including code examples and mathematical derivations.\n  We begin with a description of the model's formal structure and theoretical foundations - covering slab-based layering, statistical mixing, and microfacet theory - before turning to its physical components. These include metallic, dielectric, subsurface, and glossy-diffuse base substrates, followed by thin-film iridescence, coat, and fuzz layers. A special-case mode for rendering thin-walled objects is also described.\n  Additional sections explore technical topics in greater depth, such as the decoupling of specular reflectivity from transmission, the choice of parameterization for subsurface scattering, and the detailed physics of coat darkening and thin-film interference. We also discuss planned extensions, including hazy specular reflection and retroreflection.",
