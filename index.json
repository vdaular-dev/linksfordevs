More than 25% of the global population still doesn't use the internet1, and the disconnected population can reach around 80% in low-income countries, like Malawi2.\nThat's why we need a different approach to achieve a similar goal. Education, for example, cannot rely on tablets, Zoom, or Google Docs in many parts of the world, yet we can still deliver a remote learning experience through low-tech applications like USSD.\nLearning initiatives fail when we apply the rules of the hyper-connected world to the disconnected world without adapting to its context.\nHands-on needs are in the field Moreover, context adaptation is only possible based on an accurate, vivid understanding of the context, which requires extensive fieldwork and interviews. It is an in-person process of learning who, where, which, why, what, and how a certain problem emerges and evolves.",

    "Description": "Speculative decoding is a technique which uses a fast draft model to accelerate the inference of a slow target model. With the right verification procedure, speculative decoding can be lossless (i.e. it reproduces the quality of the target model). For token-by-token verification procedures, the criteria for lossless decoding can be written as a system of linear equations and inequalities. The acceptance rate, which directly controls model throughput, is also linear in the same variables. Thus, the optimal verification procedure is obtained by solving a linear program. This linear program is equivalent to an optimal transport problem from the draft distribution to the target distribution.",

    "Description": "Let's be honest, the financial landscape feels… weird lately. For years, the mantra for most investors has been clear: diversify, buy stable index funds, and let time work its magic. It wasn't the most thrilling advice, but it was generally sound. The idea was that the underlying fundamentals of the economy and the companies within it would eventually drive long-term returns.",

You’ve made a lasting contribution to “our” culture (or should that be “culture”?)\nI first read HGttG in my early teens. I doubled over laughing the whole time. I read and reread the entire series, bought both Dirk Gently books AND Last Chance to See. Loved them all and wouldn’t trade having read them for anything. (btw, the first mental ward scene in Long Dark Teatime is a no-foolin’, all-time classic.)",
