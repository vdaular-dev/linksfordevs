Built on top of Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Base, which adopts a novel architecture with hybrid attention and MoE, Qwen3-Coder-Next has been agentically trained at scale on large-scale executable task synthesis, environment interaction, and reinforcement learning, obtaining strong coding and agentic capabilities with significantly lower inference costs.\nScaling Agentic Training Rather than relying solely on parameter scaling, Qwen3-Coder-Next focuses on scaling agentic training signals.",
