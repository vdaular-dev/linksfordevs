When submitting review articles or position papers, authors must include documentation of successful peer review to receive full consideration. Review/survey articles or position papers submitted to arXiv without this documentation will be likely to be rejected and not appear on arXiv.\n\nThis change is being implemented due to the unmanageable influx of review articles and position papers to arXiv CS.",
