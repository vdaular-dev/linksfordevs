    "Description": "reposting from the Internet time service list\n\n\njeff.s...@nist.gov <jeff.sherman@nist.gov>: Dec 19 05:18PM -0800\n\nDear colleagues,\n\nIn short, the atomic ensemble time scale at our Boulder campus has failed\ndue to a prolonged utility power outage. One impact is that the Boulder\nInternet Time Services no longer have an accurate time reference. At time\nof writing the Boulder servers are still available due a standby power\ngenerator, but I will attempt to disable them to avoid disseminating\nincorrect time.\n\nThe affected servers are:\ntime-a-b.nist.gov\ntime-b-b.nist.gov\ntime-c-b.nist.gov\ntime-d-b.nist.gov\ntime-e-b.nist.gov\nntp-b.nist.gov (authenticated NTP)\n\nNo time to repair estimate is available until we regain staff access and\npower. Efforts are currently focused on obtaining an alternate source of\npower so the hydrogen maser clocks survive beyond their battery backups.\n\nMore details follow.\n\nDue to prolonged high wind gusts there have been a combination of utility\npower line damage and preemptive utility shutdowns (in the interest of\nwildfire prevention) in the Boulder, CO area. NIST's campus lost utility\npower Wednesday (Dec. 17 2025) around 22:23 UTC. At time of writing utility\npower is still off to the campus. Facility operators anticipated needing to\nshutdown the heat-exchange infrastructure providing air cooling to many\nparts of the building, including some internal networking closets. As a\nresult, many of these too were preemptively shutdown with the result that\nour group lacks much of the monitoring and control capabilities we\nordinarily have. Also, the site has been closed to all but emergency\npersonnel Thursday and Friday, and at time of writing remains closed.\n\nAt initial power loss, there was no immediate impact to the NIST atomic\ntime scale or distribution services because the projects are afforded\nstandby power generators. However, we now have strong evidence one of the\ncrucial generators has failed. In the downstream path is the primary signal\ndistribution chain, including to the Boulder Internet Time Service. Another\ncampus building houses additional clocks backed up by a different power\ngenerator; if these survive it will allow us to re-align the primary time\nscale when site stability returns without making use of external clocks or\nreference signals.\n\nBest wishes,\n-Jeff Sherman\nproject email: internet-time-service@nist.gov\n\nAnneJ (watching from Edinburgh, UK)",
