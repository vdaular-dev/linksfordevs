This system is responsible for the threading of renderer work on the CPU, and feeding that work to the GPU. \n\nWatch to learn about the modern Unreal Engine renderer threading design, which is valuable when analysing Unreal Insights traces for rendering related performance issues.\n\nLearn more about Unreal Engine here: unrealengine.com\n\n#GPUProfiler, #RHISubmissionPipeline, #UnrealInsights, #UnrealEngine, #UE5.6, #UnrealFestStockholm",

Looking back after having a better understanding of both Hugo and Netlify, my complaints are pretty dumb. I’ve learned from certain mistakes like using GitHub submodules unnecessarily and being able to read docs better.\nMy newest complaint however is a bit more valid. I’ve been reading more and more regarding AI scrapers and was curious what kind of bot traffic my blog was receiving. So I go on Netlify and look around for logs. Can’t find any kind of access logs. Find out that Netlify does offer logs, however they are on their paid plan, and they do not provide really the level of detail compared to logs from like nginx. Since I already self host a VM running nginx, I decided I might as well throw that on it too. I’ve also starting building up monitoring for everything in my home lab. Lots of messing around with SNMP (I hate it) and Grafana’s LGTM stack. My overall plan is to eventually create some kind of primitive NOC & SOC.",
