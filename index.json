On 19 established benchmarks, it demonstrates performance comparable to leading models such as GPT-5.2-Thinking, Claude-Opus-4.5, and Gemini 3 Pro.\nWe further enhance Qwen3-Max-Thinking with two key innovations: (1) adaptive tool-use capabilities that enable on-demand retrieval and code interpreter invocation, now available at chat.",

In vibe coding, an AI agent builds software by selecting and assembling open-source software (OSS), often without users directly reading documentation, reporting bugs, or otherwise engaging with maintainers. We study the equilibrium effects of vibe coding on the OSS ecosystem. We develop a model with endogenous entry and heterogeneous project quality in which OSS is a scalable input into producing more software. Users choose whether to use OSS directly or through vibe coding. Vibe coding raises productivity by lowering the cost of using and building on existing code, but it also weakens the user engagement through which many maintainers earn returns. When OSS is monetized only through direct user engagement, greater adoption of vibe coding lowers entry and sharing, reduces the availability and quality of OSS, and reduces welfare despite higher productivity. Sustaining OSS at its current scale under widespread vibe coding requires major changes in how maintainers are paid.",
