    "Description": "A few days ago I cleaned up 200GB from my Mac and deliberately kept my Claude Code history at 2.3GB. Four days later it had grown to 9.5GB. Here’s how I pruned it back to 1.1GB without breaking conversation continuity.\nThis also broke ccs - my fuzzy finder for Claude conversations. Parsing 3GB JSONL files was taking forever. I’ve since added --max-size filtering to ccs (defaults to 1GB), but that just hides the problem. Better to prune the files themselves.",
