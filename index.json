    "Description": "I’ve been using Claude Code extensively for personal projects, and similar AI coding tools at work. Recently I came across this excellent blog post that resonated with a lot of my experience.\nOne part stuck with me though: Noah emphasizes that tools fail with LLMs when they’re “overly complex,” with the Unix philosophy being particularly well-suited for tool calling. But then I thought about git.\nGit breaks the Unix philosophy completely. It’s sprawling, stateful, and complex. And yet Claude Code handles it effortlessly. It composes commands that, even after 10+ years of daily git usage, I wouldn’t think to use. It handles rebasing, cherry-picking, complex resets—stuff that trips up experienced developers regularly.",
