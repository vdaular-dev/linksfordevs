    "Description": "Agent Skills are structured packages of procedural knowledge that augment LLM agents at inference time. Despite rapid adoption, there is no standard way to measure whether they actually help. We present SkillsBench, a benchmark of 86 tasks across 11 domains paired with curated Skills and deterministic verifiers. Each task is evaluated under three conditions: no Skills, curated Skills, and self-generated Skills. We test 7 agent-model configurations over 7,308 trajectories. Curated Skills raise average pass rate by 16.2 percentage points(pp), but effects vary widely by domain (+4.5pp for Software Engineering to +51.9pp for Healthcare) and 16 of 84 tasks show negative deltas. Self-generated Skills provide no benefit on average, showing that models cannot reliably author the procedural knowledge they benefit from consuming. Focused Skills with 2--3 modules outperform comprehensive documentation, and smaller models with Skills can match larger models without them.",

    "Description": "Dyslexia is a difference in the way the brain processes language. It is often defined as the difference between intelligence (vaguely defined via the fake IQ test) and a person's ability to read. That is, a dyslexic with normal intelligence will underperform compared to their peers in learning how to read. There are many different theories on what the cause is, but most people believe that there are fundamental differences between the brains of people who have dyslexia and those that do not. In Maryanne Wolf's book, Dyslexia, Fluency, and the Brain, several essays point to a physical difference in the density of specialized brain cells that the brain uses to process letter shapes. It has become clear recently from fMRIs that dyslexics actually develop unique neural pathways for reading that are located in the right side of the brain compared to the normal left-side-dominated reading pathways. However, a root cause has not been identified, and the jury is still out. Dyslexia varies considerably, with up to 15% of the population experiencing some form of it.",
