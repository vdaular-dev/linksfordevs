    "Description": "Before consoles dominated the living room and before personal computers became household appliances, owning a computer at home felt like stepping into the future.\n\nIn the late 1970s through the 1980s and early 1990s, classic home computers began appearing on desks, kitchen tables, and bedrooms around the world. These machines weren’t just for games, they were tools for learning, experimenting, programming, and discovering how technology really worked.\n\nThis video explores some of the most influential classic home computer platforms, including systems from Commodore, Atari, Apple, Texas Instruments, Tandy, and others that helped define early home computing.\n\nThis is not an exhaustive list, the home computer market was massive and constantly evolving, but it is a look at the machines that mattered most, the ones many of us grew up with, learned on, and still remember today.\n\nFrom cassette tapes and floppy disks to command lines and BASIC programming, these computers laid the groundwork for the digital world we now take for granted.\n\nIf you enjoy retro tech, classic computing, and gaming history, consider liking, commenting, and subscribing to help keep this history alive.\n\n🖥️ RetroGamer Gen X- documenting the technology we grew up with.\n\n💬 Tell me in the comments: Which Computer you liked the best? \n👉 Love retro gaming?

Geometry virtualization and displacement systems like Nanite has allowed us to substantially increase the geometry resolution. But when it comes to representing small details like cavities, cracks, and creases, those types of solutions are too expensive to be used systemically in a game for a current generation console. As long as we have to rely on normal maps to encode geometric detail there will be a need to handle direct lighting occlusion at the mesoscopic scale. To do that most engines have relied on baking micro-occlusion onto textures or buffers. While that workaround is better than nothing, it results in a flat representation of those small details. In this series of posts I’ll touch on the issues with micro-occlusion and look at micro-shadowing as an improvement.",
