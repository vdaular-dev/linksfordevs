    "Description": "Vibe coding is a new programming paradigm in which human engineers instruct large language model (LLM) agents to complete complex coding tasks with little supervision. Although it is increasingly adopted, are vibe coding outputs really safe to deploy in production? To answer this question, we propose SU S VI B E S, a benchmark consisting of 200 feature-request software engineering tasks from real-world open-source projects, which, when given to human programmers, led to vulnerable implementations. We evaluate multiple widely used coding agents with frontier models on this benchmark. Disturbingly, all agents perform poorly in terms of software security. Although 61% of the solutions from SWE-Agent with Claude 4 Sonnet are functionally correct, only 10.5% are secure. Further experiments demonstrate that preliminary security strategies, such as augmenting the feature request with vulnerability hints, cannot mitigate these security issues. Our findings raise serious concerns about the widespread adoption of vibe-coding, particularly in security-sensitive applications.",

We tested NATS JetStream, version 2.12.1, and found that it lost writes if data files were truncated or corrupted on a minority of nodes. We also found that coordinated power failures, or an OS crash on a single node combined with network delays or process pauses, can cause the loss of committed writes and persistent split-brain. This data loss was caused (at least in part) by choosing to flush writes to disk every two minutes, rather than before acknowledging them. We also include a belated note on data loss due to process crashes in version 2.10.22, which was fixed in 2.10.23. NATS has now documented the risk of its default fsync policy, and the remaining issues remain under investigation. This research was performed independently by Jepsen, without compensation, and conducted in accordance with the Jepsen ethics policy.",
