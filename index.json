They were actually stupid enough to dox all their users on the home page of their website of all places. \n\nInterview Coder is the least legit AI product of all time and they are about to be sued into oblivion. Their \"lifetime access\" isn't going to exist once they are bankrupt from these candidates suing them for leaking all their personal information. Interview Coder leaked their users' names, compensation details, home addresses and more. The funny thing is, this isn't even their first data breach. Last year, they left their API keys exposed in a public Github repo. \n\nTimestamps \n00:00:00 | Interview Coder Exposes Users' Identities   \n00:00:14 | Interview Coder Reveals Current Amazon SWE Who Cheated\n00:01:10 | Interview Coder Reveals FlipKart SWE Who Cheated \n00:01:34 | Microsoft SWE Cheater Revealed \n00:02:00 | NVIDIA SWE Cheater Exposed and Blacklisted\n00:02:48 | IBM Cheater Exposed and Blacklisted  \n00:03:12 | Interview Coder Selling User Data to HackerRank \n00:03:35 | Apple SWE Caught Cheating with Interview Coder \n00:03:47 | Interview Coder CEO Brags About Revealing Cheaters on Twitter\n\n#interviewcoder #cluely #roylee",
